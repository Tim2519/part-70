If you started the Indie Game Development Pipeline with Volume 1, you've had a chance to work on your game concept art and begin creating the actual game functionality.\n\nIn this volume, we'll build the 3D geometry for our hero character, a ghostly knight, using Maya LT. We'll begin by looking at the concept art and then jump into modeling the character's helmet. We'll look at a variety of polygon modeling tools as well as how we can integrate NURBS into our game modeling workflow.\n\nOnce our geometry is built, we'll spend some time creating a UV layout in preparation for texturing. Then we'll use Photoshop and Mudbox to create a texture for the Ghost Knight.\n\nOnce you've completed this volume, you can move on to Volume 5 where we'll go through the process of building up the rock monster boss for our game using Maya LT and ZBrush. Then you can continue on with subsequent volumes on rigging, animation, and final game assembly.\n\nThese tutorials are step-by-step using our particular concepts, but we really encourage you to have some fun and make it your own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38beccc881c8619c35102d226f95b5ba70284842","amp;dn":"Indie+Game+Dev+Pipeline+Vol+4+Hero+Character+Modeling+and+Textur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38beccc881c8619c35102d226f95b5ba70284842","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,190,204,200,129,200,97,156,53,16,45,34,111,149,181,186,112,40,72,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
