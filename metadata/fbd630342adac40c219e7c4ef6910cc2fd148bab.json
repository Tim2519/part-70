He is hired by Evelyn Mulwray when she suspects her husband Hollis, builder of the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s water supply system, of having an affair. Gittes does what he does best and photographs him with a young girl but in the ensuing scandal, it seems he was hired by an impersonator and not the real Mrs. Mulwray.
