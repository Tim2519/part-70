I based my tracklist on four setlists from 1977 and 1978 shows, trying to get the songs grouped together in the same order as on the lists.  A lot of artistic freedom was taken in this, but I think I got it to sound like a real show would.\n\nThe tracklist is as follows:\n\n01 Hopelssly Human\n02 Song For America\n03 Point Of Know Return\n04 Paradox\n05 Icarus (Born On Wings Of Steel)\n06 Down The Road\n07 Belexes\n08 Closet Chronicles\n09 Mysteries &amp; Mayhem\n10 Excerpt From Lamplight Symphony\n11 The Wall\n12 Lonely Street\n13 Dust In The Wind-Acoustic Guitar solo\n14 Lonely Wind-Piano solo\n15 Cheyenne Anthem \n16 Miracles Out Of Nowhere\n17 Child Of Innocence\n18 The Spider\n19 Portrait (He Knows)\n20 Carry On Wayward Son\n21 Journey From Mariabronn\n22 Sparks Of The Tempest\n23 Magnum Opus\n24 Bringing It Back","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7c1d382ab9250146ef0541df604f11b40f39b0c","amp;dn":"Kansas+-+Two+For+The+Show+%28resequenced+by+%7D%7Beywood%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7c1d382ab9250146ef0541df604f11b40f39b0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,193,211,130,171,146,80,20,110,240,84,29,246,4,241,27,64,243,155,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
