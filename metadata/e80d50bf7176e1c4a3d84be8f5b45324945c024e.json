Surgeon Simulator 2013 includes the alien autopsy level!\n    More operations including double kidney transplant and brain transplant!\n    New visuals and a pumping new soundtrack.\n\nOverview:\n\nSurgeon Simulator 2013 is a darkly humorous over-the-top operation sim game where players become Nigel Burke, a would-be surgeon taking life into his own shaky hands, performing life-saving surgical manoeuvres on passive patients.\n\nThe original prototype Ã¢â‚¬â€œ developed in just 48 hours at the 2013 Global Game Jam in January Ã¢â‚¬â€œ challenged players to complete a heart transplant, armed only with an arsenal of clumsy and inappropriate tools and a hand that was diabolically difficult to control, using a combination of keyboard and mouse actions.\n\nThe full version comes with additional features, operations and environments. From carrying out terrifying transplants in theater to surgical procedures in the back of an ambulance, Surgeon Simulator 2013 now takes operating to the next level.\n\nMinimum system requirements: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8, 2.0 GHz processor or faster, Memory: 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended), Graphics: NVIDIA Geforce 7800 GT or better, DirectX 9.0c-compatible sound card, 500 MB hard drive space, keyboard, mouse.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e80d50bf7176e1c4a3d84be8f5b45324945c024e","amp;dn":"Surgeon+Simulator+2013+GOG+v.2.0.0.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e80d50bf7176e1c4a3d84be8f5b45324945c024e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,13,80,191,113,118,225,196,163,216,75,232,245,180,83,36,148,92,2,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
