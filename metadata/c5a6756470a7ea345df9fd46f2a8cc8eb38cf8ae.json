The win seems like a stroke of luck, but as with so many things in vibrant, seductive, contradictory BangkokÃ¢â‚¬â€a city of innocence and evil, power and povertyÃ¢â‚¬â€the allure of appearances masks something much darker. Within a few hours of folding his cards, Rafferty, his wife, Rose, beloved Ã‚Â­adopted daughter, Miaow, and best friend, Arthit, an honest Bangkok cop, have become pawns in a political struggle among some of Thailand's richest, most powerful, and most ruthless people.\n\nA hero to the poor and dispossessed, Pan is like a bone in the throats of the beautiful, sophisticated &quot;good&quot; people who own and control every facet of Thailand and want more. There are many who would prefer that a book, especially a sympathetic book, stay unwritten. And there are others who want to expose Pan's darker secrets, information useful in a preemptive strike against this profligate billionaire who can threaten their hold on powerÃ¢â‚¬â€a situation they will go to murderous lengths to prevent.\n\nDamned if he does, damned if he doesn't, Rafferty is breathing water and sinking deeper in a sea of intrigue with each passing hour. The trouble multiplies when a missing young street friend of Miaow's reappears, needing Rafferty's help to protect an innocent village girl trapped in a baby-selling ring. Pushed ever closer to the abyss, Rafferty has one chance to get them all out alive. But to succeed, this foreigner must do the impossibleÃ¢â‚¬â€keep a cool Thai heart.\n\nSet in the Thailand of today's headlinesÃ¢â‚¬â€a nation of unrest, political uncertainty, corruption, and tradition, where the future looks dangerously precariousÃ¢â‚¬â€Breathing Water is the story of a deadly game in which the stakes are enormous and life is literally cheap. The most compelling Poke Rafferty thriller yet, it is a journey that goes beyond the illusion of order and stability into a world where a wrong turn can lead to chaos, and where love and courage may not be enough to hold back the darkness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5a6756470a7ea345df9fd46f2a8cc8eb38cf8ae","amp;dn":"Breathing+Water+%5BPoke+Rafferty+Mystery%2C+%233%5D+-+Timothy+Hallinan.e","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5a6756470a7ea345df9fd46f2a8cc8eb38cf8ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,166,117,100,112,167,234,52,93,249,253,70,242,168,204,142,179,140,248,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
