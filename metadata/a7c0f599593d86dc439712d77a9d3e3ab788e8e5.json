The main concerts are from the &quot;Live In Japan&quot; 3 CD set.  On that set several songs are missing in order to fit each show on one CD.  On a computer there are no such time restrictions, so I rebuilt the shows to be complete.  The music released on the original version of &quot;Made In Japan&quot; is here taken from the DCC Gold disc release.  Also used was the bonus encores disc from the remastered version of &quot;Made In Japan&quot; and the one remaining missing track from the &quot;Listen, Learn, Read On&quot; box set.  I originally created this set in December 2007 from mp3 sources, but this is an entirely new remake from all lossless sources done in 2011.\n\nPart 1 : Osaka August 15, 1972\n\n1. Highway Star\n2.
