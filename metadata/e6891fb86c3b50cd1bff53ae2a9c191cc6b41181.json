Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. To their surprise,\n the album sold several thousand units via the Internet, TV home shopping, and phone orders,\n and Babb and Schendel were convinced that the band was a project worth continuing.\n\nWhile many musicians have appeared on Glass Hammer albums over the years, Babb and Schendel have\n remained the core of the band. Both men play a variety of instruments,\n but Babb mainly concentrates on bass guitar and keyboards while Schendel\n also plays keyboards as well as various guitars and drums\n (until the addition of live drummer Matt Mendians to the studio recording band in 2004).\n They also sing, although a number of other vocalists (most notably Michelle Young, Walter Moore,\nSusie Bogdanowicz and Jon Davison) have also handled lead vocal duties.\n\nLyrically, Glass Hammer is inspired mostly by their love of fantasy literature\n (most notably Tolkien and C. S. Lewis) and by their Christian faith. Although by their own\n admission they have tried to avoid becoming an overtly Christian band,\n their 2002 release Lex Rex was a concept album based on a Roman soldier's encounter with Jesus.\n\nMusically, their most apparent influences are Yes, Kansas, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer and,\n to a less noticeable extent, Genesis. While Glass Hammer has, for the most part, combined those\n influences into a characteristic style of their own, they made much more direct references to\n the aforementioned bands on their 2000 album Chronometree, which told the story of a\n drug-addled progressive rock fan who becomes convinced aliens are speaking to him through\n the music he listens to.\n\nIn 2012, Jon Davison was selected by Yes as their new lead singer, while remaining a member\n of Glass Hammer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6891fb86c3b50cd1bff53ae2a9c191cc6b41181","amp;dn":"Glass+Hammer+%2F+Discography+%2817Al-18CD%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6891fb86c3b50cd1bff53ae2a9c191cc6b41181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,137,31,184,108,59,80,205,27,255,83,174,42,156,25,28,198,180,17,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
