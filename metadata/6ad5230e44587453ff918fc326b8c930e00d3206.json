Next we'll focus on the elements of shape and form and how the relate to one another in both 2D and 3D. From there we'll study value and we can use value add volume and dimension to a form. Follow this we'll discover how we can draw objects in space by using one, two, and three point perspective. Along the way we will also learn about some key principles of composition and how we can use them to create visually appealing and eye catching pieces of art. Finally, we'll learn about the basic properties of color.\nBy the end of this training, you'll have a much stronger understanding of the foundational elements of art and how to start applying them to your own work.\n\nTutor\nKurt Jones\n\n10 Lessons\n\n1.
