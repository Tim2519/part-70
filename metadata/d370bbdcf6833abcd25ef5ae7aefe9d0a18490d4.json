In fact, the title doesn't just summarize the premise but also pretty much the entirety of the book's decidedly uninspired plot. Fortunately, the execution is superb on most other counts, which still lifts the work as a whole above mediocrity, if barely.\n\n\n---\n\n\nSingle volume compiled from Empire's brand-new Digital Hi-Res re-releases, bookended with a collection cover and a gallery with four full sets of single-issue variants.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d370bbdcf6833abcd25ef5ae7aefe9d0a18490d4","amp;dn":"Warren+Ellis%3A+Captain+Swing+and+the+Electrical+Pirates+%28Dgtl-HR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d370bbdcf6833abcd25ef5ae7aefe9d0a18490d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,112,187,220,246,131,58,188,210,94,245,174,122,239,233,208,161,132,144,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
