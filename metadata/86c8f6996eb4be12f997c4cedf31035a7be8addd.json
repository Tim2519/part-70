You are free to download this definitive electronic text of the King James Bible (KJB). The actual King James Bible text of the Cambridge Edition (PCE) has been presented free of any typographical error, and is completely correct. It is scrupulously exact in typesetting right down to the italics and punctuation.\n \nThis precise edition of the King James Bible is wholly based on the received traditional text as was published by Cambridge University Press and by Collins publishers. God's Word is necessary for true salvation. The English Bible has been providentially raised up by God for a great dissemination of the true Gospel.\n \nThe Cambridge Edition (first published circa 1900) is the product of the process of textual editing that has occurred since 1611 when the Authorized Version was completed. Please note that there've been no revisions of the Bible since the authorized 1611 King James Bible was first released, only editions (such as spelling standardization). There is nothing wrong with the unedited Authorized 1611 King James Bible. It contains no errors. The standardization of English words does not mean that there are any errors in the original work.\n \nSome people refer to the Cambridge Edition as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pure Cambridge Edition,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“pureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is improper, because the Words of the Lord are pure (Psalm 12:6-8). To refer to the Cambridge Edition as Ã¢â‚¬Å“pureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ implies the the Authorized 1611 King James Bible is less pure or impure. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Authorized 1611 King James Version is pure, because God's Word is pure and the actual translation of the King James Bible has NOT been revised since 1611. So I deliberately refrain from using the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“pureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in reference to any particular edition of the King James Bible, because the original Authorized 1611 King James Bible is as 100% pure as the Cambridge Edition. My intent here is not to diminish the impeccable quality of the Cambridge Edition; but rather, to uphold the integrity, purity, inspiration and inerrancy of the Authorized 1611 Edition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86c8f6996eb4be12f997c4cedf31035a7be8addd","amp;dn":"Cambridge+KJV+Bible+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86c8f6996eb4be12f997c4cedf31035a7be8addd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,200,246,153,110,180,190,18,249,151,196,206,223,49,3,90,123,232,173,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
