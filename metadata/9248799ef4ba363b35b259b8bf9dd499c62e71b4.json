He has also released numerous solo albums (initially featuring other members of the Legendary Pink Dots, and including contributions from Steven Stapleton), and has worked in various side projects, including The Tear Garden (with cEvin Key of Skinny Puppy), and Mimir (with Phil Knight, Christoph Heemann, Jim O'Rourke and others).\n\nKa-Spel's solo albums range from abstract electronic noise to more traditional pop songs, incorporating diverse elements of psychedelia, industrial, avant garde, experimental electronic, art pop, classical music, folk (nursery songs), sampling, noise, collage, music concrete, etc. His lyrics have been described as intensely mystical, incorporating recurrent themes from his own personal mythos. Ka-Spel's songwriting has been compared (usually favourably) to that of Syd Barrett and early Pink Floyd, though the artist describes the comparison as being a coincidence, not a direct influence. Ka-Spel has cited Iannis Xenakis, The Beatles, Nurse With Wound, David Bowie, Brainticket, Can, The Residents, Magma, and Throbbing Gristle as significant influences.\n\nKa-Spel often appears on stage barefoot, wearing a long scarf and either pink or black optic glasses. Early in his career, he drew black lines on his face and arms, which Phil Knight has referred to as &quot;his cracks&quot;, presumably as they resemble the cracked lines of a china doll, an image very present in his early albums.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9248799ef4ba363b35b259b8bf9dd499c62e71b4","amp;dn":"Edward+Ka-Spel+FLAC+Discography+%28ex-+Legendary+Pink+Dots%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9248799ef4ba363b35b259b8bf9dd499c62e71b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,72,121,158,244,186,54,59,53,178,89,184,191,157,212,153,198,46,113,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
