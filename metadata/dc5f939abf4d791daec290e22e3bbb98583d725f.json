The success of 1978's DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Let Go seemed to make the proceedings of this album more relaxed and confident. The ballads typify And Once Again more than anything else. Throughout most of the slow tracks here Hayes seems to be trying to attain a more thoughtful approach and seems to be reminiscent of his Black Moses era. His cover of Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s All in the GameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is slowed down a little bit and he gives a surprisingly impassioned vocal and an updated and deft arrangement. The entertaining Ã¢â‚¬Å“IkeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rap VIIIÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has a glorious string arrangement and flows into a good cover of Angie BofillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1978 classic Ã¢â‚¬Å“This Time IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Be Sweeter.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Another ballad, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wherever You AreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has an atmospheric and haunting melody that made up for the wobbly lyrics. The dance tracks here arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t great. Both Ã¢â‚¬Å“I AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t NeverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love Has Been Good to UsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ had rhythms and \nprouction values that were on the way out by the time this hit the shelves. Hayes seemed to give his best dance material for a production job with Linda Clifford. This effort didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have an especially long chart run and was a chart disappointment in contrast to DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Let Go. Although there is nothing groundbreaking here, the sound arrangements and HayesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ vocals make this more than worthwhile.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc5f939abf4d791daec290e22e3bbb98583d725f","amp;dn":"Isaac+Hayes+-+And+Once+Again+%28Expanded+Edition+2014%29+MP3%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc5f939abf4d791daec290e22e3bbb98583d725f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,95,147,154,191,77,121,29,174,194,144,226,46,59,187,152,88,61,114,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
