Sons of the Great Bear takes the side of the &quot;Indians&quot;, showing them as honourable victims of unscrupulous gringos; apparently it was a big success, and started a wave of &quot;Red Westerns&quot;.\n\nAside from role-inversion, the story is very conventional. It was made at a time when Sergio Leone was revolutionizing the genre with his spaghetti-westerns, but Sons of the Great Bear seems less inspired. They went to great lengths to get aboriginal ethnographic details exactly right, but the gringos aren't so lucky - viewers have pointed out errors in military uniforms and map-boundaries.\n\nI cpped the movie from youtube and the subtitles from opensubs. Unfortunately, the thing is hardsubbed in Russian, so the subtitles occasionally conflict; maybe someone can figure a way to transpose the English subs to the top of the picture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a06f1d0c783ec394e3a7c35d232810e80e956df1","amp;dn":"Sons+of+the+Great+Bear+%281966%29+Red+Western","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a06f1d0c783ec394e3a7c35d232810e80e956df1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,111,29,12,120,62,195,148,227,167,195,93,35,40,16,232,14,149,109,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
