Giants are typically\nseveral stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all,\nseem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity\nsurvived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of giants.\n\nFlash forward to the present and the city has not seen a giant in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his\nfoster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a super giant that appears\nout of thin air. As the smaller giants flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive.\nEren vows that he will murder every single giant and take revenge for all of mankind.\n\n\nVIDEO\n- Video Source: BD-J\n- Video Codec: H.264/AVC\n- Video Resolution: 1920x1080p HD (16:9)\n- Video FPS: 23.976\n\nAUDIO\n- Codec: AC3 &amp; FLAC\n- Track 1: English: 5.1ch (AC3 640Kbps)\n- Track 2: Japanese: Stereo (FLAC 24bit)\n\nSUBTITLES\n- Track 1: English Signs/Songs\n- Track 2: English Subtitles\n\nEXTRAS\n- English Commentary\n\nCOMMENTS\n- Other extras &amp; episodes will be included in a Batch release.\n- Please excuse the large file size as they're many factors on why it's big!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db85876448d2177071eb6c9d06950c71e4fc9cfe","amp;dn":"%5BCBM%5D+Attack+on+Titan+1-13+%28Dual+Audio%29+%5BBDRip-1080p-8bit-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db85876448d2177071eb6c9d06950c71e4fc9cfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,133,135,100,72,210,23,112,113,235,108,157,6,149,12,113,228,252,156,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
