Now a strange letter beckons her to Vienna, promising to unlock the mysteries of her past. With each step, she comes closer to remembering connections between a clandestine reincarnationist society, Beethoven's lost flute and journalist David Yalom.\n\nDavid knows loss firsthandÃ¢â‚¬â€terrorism took his entire family. Now, beneath a concert hall in Vienna, he plots a violent wake-up call to illustrate the world's need for true security.\n\nJoin international bestselling author M. J. Rose in her unforgettable novel about a woman paralyzed by the past, a man robbed of his future and a secret centuries old.\n\n**\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nStarred Review. Near the start of Rose's fascinating follow-up to The Reincarnationist (2007), Meer Logan visits the Manhattan office of Malachai Samuels, the erudite head of a reincarnation foundation. When Malachai shows her an auction catalogue photo of a gaming box once owned by a friend of Ludwig van Beethoven, the photo closely resembles a sketch Meer made as a child based on what Meer wishes were false memories. Malachai believes Meer has been haunted by past-life memories, in particular those of Margaux Neidermier, whose husband in 1814 asked Beethoven to decipher a song inscribed on an ancient flute. The box turns out to contain a Beethoven letter suggesting the composer didn't destroy the &quot;memory flute&quot; as he claimed to have done at the time. When the box is stolen soon after Meer examines it, she heads to Vienna for answers. Alas, others are on the same trail, including FBI Special Agent Lucien Glass of the Art Crime Team, Austrian authorities and assorted thieves. Rose skillfully blends past-life mysteries with present-day chills. The result is a smashing good read. (Nov.) \nCopyright Ã‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nFrom Booklist\n\nAlthough not exactly a sequel to The Reincarnationist (2007), this novel combines mystery and fantasy in the same way. Meer Logan is still haunted by the memories she experienced as a child, memories that seemed to reveal a past life. Now, spurred on by a letter ostensibly written by Beethoven and a picture that resembles a vision that appeared to her many years ago, she travels to Vienna to try to find out who she isÃ¢â‚¬â€and who she was. The story is quite convolutedÃ¢â‚¬â€it involves past lives, a mysterious flute, and a journalist seeking revenge for a terrorist act that destroyed his lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€but Rose tells it elegantly, moving gracefully between characters, between time and place, and building both momentum and suspense. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more skillfully written than The Reincarnationist, and, as with that novel, there are dozens of ways it could have collapsed under its own weight. But it never does, and for that reason it should be recommended highly to readers who appreciate mysteries tinged with the supernatural. --David Pitt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8d31a17094c1742550f93fa5fa43901a0ef6707","amp;dn":"The+Memorist+%5B%232%2C+Reincarnationist%5D+-+M.+J.+Rose","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8d31a17094c1742550f93fa5fa43901a0ef6707","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,211,26,23,9,76,23,66,85,15,147,250,95,164,57,1,160,239,103,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
