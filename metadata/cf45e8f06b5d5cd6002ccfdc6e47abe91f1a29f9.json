The town's sheriff is shot and killed during the robbery. Billy hides the stolen money while his brother and the rest of the gang return to locked jail cells as an alibi. When Cahill returns, he and Danny look for the perpetrators with the help of half-Comanche tracker Lightfoot (Neville Brand). Cahill arrests four suspects and although they are innocent, they are found guilty and scheduled to be hanged. Eventually, Cahill's sons try to return the gang's share of the money to Fraser, resulting in a showdown between Cahill, his sons and Lightfoot on one side and Fraser's gang on the other.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 103 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 103 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf45e8f06b5d5cd6002ccfdc6e47abe91f1a29f9","amp;dn":"Cahill%2C+United+States+Marshall+%281973%29+Xvid+1cd+-+John+Wayne%2C+Mar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf45e8f06b5d5cd6002ccfdc6e47abe91f1a29f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,69,232,240,107,93,92,214,0,44,207,220,110,71,171,233,31,26,41,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
