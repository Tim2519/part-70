The editors and writers of the magazine have covered historical information and stories on the development of keyboards from their inception with pioneers like Moog Music. At times, editorial and guest articles in the magazine have covered subjects including music philosophy and keyboarding instruction, music theory and harmonics.\n\nIt is not uncommon to find advertisements and endorsements for high tech audio gear and computer hardware and software within the pages of the two editions\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa31806446191d2753b80c553d827c3e96621e47","amp;dn":"Keyboard+Magazine+2013+All+issues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa31806446191d2753b80c553d827c3e96621e47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,49,128,100,70,25,29,39,83,184,12,85,61,130,124,62,150,98,30,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
