Founded in Warren, MI, a bedroom community on the outskirts of metropolitan Detroit, the band features Devin Oliver (vocals), among other members. I See Stars released an EP, Green Light Go (2006), and an assortment of demo recordings prior to signing a recording contract with Sumerian Records in 2008. In collaboration with producers Cameron Mizzell and James Paul Wisner, whose credits include alternative rock stars such as Paramore, Dashboard Confessional, and New Found Glory, I See Stars made their full-length album debut in 2009 with 3D. The album sold relatively well for a band of unknown teenagers from the Midwest, reaching number 176 on the Billboard 200, and a video for the song &quot;What This Means to Me&quot; was released in promotion. The band toured extensively in support of 3D, playing practically a show each day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6bd730205df7b9cdef707ad9f2b0fe56ee4df0f","amp;dn":"I+See+Stars+-+New+Demons+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6bd730205df7b9cdef707ad9f2b0fe56ee4df0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,189,115,2,5,223,123,156,222,247,7,173,159,43,15,229,110,228,223,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
