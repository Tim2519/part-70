(vinyl 24 96)\n\nThis live set with organist Milt Buckner and drummer Tony Crombie is quite fun. Tenor great Illinois Jacquet roars throughout &quot;The King,&quot; &quot;C Jam Blues&quot; and &quot;Take The 'A' Train,&quot; makes a warm ballad statement on &quot;Easy Living&quot; and on &quot;I Wanna Blow Now&quot; he takes an enthusiastic vocal that is highlighted by a surprisingly effective imitation of Ella Fitzgerald. The LP has been long out-of-print but it is worth picking up even if Buckner's organ playing lacks much subtlety. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01. The King 05:41\n02. Easy Living 06:15\n03. C Jam Blues 07:57\n04. Take The A Train 10:06\n05. I Wanna Blow Now 08:35\n\nPersonnel:\nIllinois Jacquet: tenor sax, vocals\nMilt Buckner: organ\nTony Crombie: drums\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7bfa8bf17b2be02d8dde660d6df237df61db758","amp;dn":"Illinois+Jacquet+-+1971+-+Genius+At+Work%21+%28vinyl+24+96%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7bfa8bf17b2be02d8dde660d6df237df61db758","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,191,168,191,23,178,190,2,216,221,230,96,214,223,35,125,246,29,183,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
