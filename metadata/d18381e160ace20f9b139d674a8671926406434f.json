The band has featured international personnel throughout its career and presently consists of Cave, violinist and multi-instrumentalist Warren Ellis, bassist Martyn P. Casey, keyboardist Conway Savage, and percussionists Thomas Wydler (Switzerland) and Jim Sclavunos (United States). The band has released fifteen studio albums and completed numerous international tours.\nThe band was founded after the demise of Cave and Harvey's former group The Birthday Party, the members of which met at a boarding school in Victoria, Australia.[2] Deviating from the noise rock roots of their contemporaries, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds have produced alternative rock that has been influenced by various genres, such as punk rock, gothic rock, no wave and blues. Their early materialÃ¢â‚¬â€From Her to Eternity (1984), The Firstborn Is Dead (1985), Your Funeral... My Trial (1986) and Tender Prey (1988)Ã¢â‚¬â€primarily featured a post-punk sound. The band has progressively incorporated other songwriting elements; for example, the 2008 release Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! experimented with garage rock, also an influence of the side project Grinderman. Synthesizers and minimal guitar work feature prominently on their newest album, Push the Sky Away (2013), recorded after the departure of Harvey in 2009.\n\n\nimage Review:\nUpon its release last February, Push the Sky Away immediately asserted itself as an outlier amid the Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds catalogue. It was the rare album of theirs to favor vaporous, smoke-ring ambience over the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notorious gavel-crushing wallop, and drifting, abstract lyricism over CaveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s usual scripture-scaled narratives. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not like this risky low-key detour hurt their live draw: the Bad SeedsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ spring 2013 tours saw them selling out soft-seaters worldwide, and a recently released 2014 itinerary sees them returning to many of the same markets at even bigger venues. Of course, it helped that Cave and co. amplified and adrenalized Push the Sky AwayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hushed tones with the assistance of guest string sections and childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s choirs, thereby placing the new material on equal footing with the old warhorses. But to prove just how on their game Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds were in 2013, the band offer us a portrait not of a typical night on the job, but of what they can do when chillinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ on a day off. \nLive From KCRW was recorded last April during the week separating the Bad SeedsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ two appearances at Coachella (where Cave, Warren Ellis, Martyn Casey, and Jim Sclavunos also pulled double duty with the their bastard-son band Grinderman), before a small studio audience at the stationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s famed Santa Monica studios. And though the Bad Seeds discography is hardly lacking for concert documentsÃ¢â‚¬â€this counts as the fourthÃ¢â‚¬â€Live From KCRW is, much like Push the Sky Away itself, something of a wild card among them. The Bad Seeds are without a doubt one of the most consistently exhilarating live acts in the biz, a band worthy of any discerning rock fanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bucket list. But theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re also guilty at times of being a predictable one. Their setlists tend to showcase whatever new albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being promoted alongside a familiar greatest-hits revue of their most canonical songs from the 1980s and 90s; to see the Bad Seeds on tour this year, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d think Push the Sky Away was their first album since 1997, their shows rarely touching upon the totemic works released in the interim.\nSo Live From KCRW is distinguished not just by its loose, casual vibeÃ¢â‚¬â€with Cave good-naturedly honoring audience requests, provided theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Ã¢â‚¬Å“on this very short listÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€but by its welcome variations from the standard Bad Seeds script with a healthy selection of deep cuts that don't get aired out that often. It begins with Push the Sky AwayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hazy-headed pocket history of modern civilization, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Higgs Boson BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, whose Miley Cyrus name-drops elicit audible giggles from the studio attendees. Its appearance here underscores just how perfectly Cave predicted her year, with the line Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hannah Montana/ Does the African SavannahÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ standing as an almost biblical prophecy of twerk-gate. And the song establishes a marked contrast here between the playful audience interaction and the solemnly reverential readings of some of the most understatedly devastating songs in the Cave songbook. The four Push the Sky Away selections find complementary counterparts in the sublimely sinister Your Funeral My Trial standout Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stranger Than KindessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the hymn-like title track to 2001Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s No More Shall We Part, and two selections from CaveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other Ã¢â‚¬Å“quietÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ album, The BoatmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Call: the bittersweet anti-anthem Ã¢â‚¬Å“People AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t No GoodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and an absolutely stunning Ã¢â‚¬Å“Far From MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that allows more room for Conway SavageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funereal organ lines to shine, transforming it from a simple break-up song to a requiem for the ruined relationship chronicled within. \nThe setÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meditative spell is broken only by the farewell dusting of the old HenryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dream rager Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jack the RipperÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which is revelatory not just as a display of the Bad SeedsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bruising muscle, but how much effort it takes to flex it. In concert, the Bad Seeds routinely perform with all the cocksure confidence of a band thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seemingly never had an off night, but the amusing 90 seconds of banter that precede Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jack the RipperÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€wherein Cave confers with his mates about the proper chords and keyÃ¢â‚¬â€betrays a rare, up-close glimpse of the volatility at the root of their imposing sound. At the same time, Live From KCRW shows that the Bad SeedsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ power isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t entirely dependent on volume. The setÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highlight is a skeletal, piano-based rendition of signature showstopper Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Mercy SeatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that shirks the originalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stormy, cinematic sweep to take us deeper inside the fragile psyche of the songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s electric-chair-bound protagonist; he may claim heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“not afraid to die,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but the repeated, intensifying incantations of the chorus make his underlying sense of panic all too palpable. It is therefore no coincidence that, instead of a performance shot, the record's front cover photo shows Cave sitting by his lonesome in the studio amid a sprawl of equipment and road cases. The recordings within reveal the rationale: Even when the Bad Seeds perform in stripped-down mode, there is still much heavy lifting to do. \nReview by Stuart Berman [7.8/10]\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n1.
