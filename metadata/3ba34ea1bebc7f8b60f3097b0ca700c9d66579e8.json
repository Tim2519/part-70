How  about  gunning?  What  if      \n         special  abilities  are  thrown   into   the   mix?      \n         Upgradable weapons? Let's say  there're  dozens  of      \n         on-screen enemies to unleash this firepower on, and      \n         as  your  reward  for  dispatching  them  you   get      \n         experience and gold to collect that can be used for      \n         character customization and new equipment - all the      \n         while  playing  alongside   friends   in   4-player      \n         cooperative play! If you  like  the  sound  of  all      \n         this, then you'll  love  God  Mode.  Retro  shooter      \n         action and RPG elements are combined  in  this  new      \n         downloadable   third-person   shooter.   God   Mode      \n         combines  non-linear  gameplay,  fast  and  frantic      \n         shooting, hordes  of  on-screen  enemies,  a  fully      \n         functional online coop mode, and  features  visuals      \n         and gameplay that rival that of a full-priced boxed      \n         title. Matches rarely (if ever) play out the  same,      \n         as dozens of in-game  modifiers  can  significantly      \n         alter the gameplay on the fly. Characters are fully      \n         customizable, both  in  appearance  and  equipment,      \n         which continually evolve. Gold and  experience  are      \n         constantly accrued  and  used  to  unlock  new  and      \n         satisfying weaponry and unique powerful  abilities,      \n         both of which can be further upgraded.                   \n                                                                  \n   \n         1- Unpack, burn or mount                                 \n         2- Install the game                                      \n         3- Copy the cracked content from PROPHET dir to          \n            &lt;installdir&gt;bin folder                               \n         4- Go To Hell!                                           \n                                                                  \n         NOTE:                                                    \n         The game is updated to newest version.
