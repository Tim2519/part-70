Anna leaves behind her beloved Mesa Verde to take on a position as district park ranger of the Mississippi Natchez Trace Parkway. Once there she faces an angry staff that refuses to work with a woman supervisor. But she pushes that difficulty aside when she stumbles over the body of a teenage girl, shrouded in a hood reminiscent of the KKK.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c4dd74d4296f9d1c737422ba1a30fc1a6c16f48","amp;dn":"Nevada+Barr-Deep+South","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c4dd74d4296f9d1c737422ba1a30fc1a6c16f48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,77,215,77,66,150,249,209,199,55,66,43,161,163,15,193,166,193,111,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
