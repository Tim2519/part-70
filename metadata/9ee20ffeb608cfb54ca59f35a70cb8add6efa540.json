They looked and acted exactly alike. Each was experiencing the thrill of first love. Each was empowered with a gift of the supernatural. And each harbored dark secrets. Jenna and Rita could have been sisters. Except for one thing . . . Rita was murdered over a century ago.\n\nOut of the yellowed pages of her diary, Rita's frightening legacy is reborn. But the more Jenna reads of Rita's spellbinding pastÃ¢â‚¬â€of murder, deception, and sinister experimentsÃ¢â‚¬â€the more she fears her own future. Because Rita's history is repeating itself, moment by horrifying moment. And Jenna has to live it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ee20ffeb608cfb54ca59f35a70cb8add6efa540","amp;dn":"Whispers+From+the+Grave+-+Leslie+Rule.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ee20ffeb608cfb54ca59f35a70cb8add6efa540","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,226,15,254,182,8,207,181,76,165,159,53,167,12,184,173,214,239,165,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
