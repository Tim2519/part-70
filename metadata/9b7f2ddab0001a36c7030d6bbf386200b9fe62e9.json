Not only has this movie endeared itself to many of the viewers that saw it when it was originally broadcast but it contains a stellar cast. It won an Emmy for Outstanding Special--Drama or Comedy as well being nominated for four others.\n\nSYNOPSIS: Successful businessman Adam Thornton, played by Edward Asner, learns that he only has a short time left to live. He decides that he wants to make peace with his family and have one last reunion. He confides this information to his estranged wife Kate Thornton (Maureen Stapleton). But when his doctor says that it won't be good for him to travel, she suggests that he call his four adult children and invite them all for Christmas. He agrees only with the provision that they not be told of his illness and imminent death. The only problem is that most of his family are not exactly fond of him because he walked out on his wife and because of his stubborn nature. Of his four children, Adam is most nervous about seeing Bud Thornton (Gregory Harrison) whom he hasn't spoken to since having an argument regarding the Vietnam War and his moving to Canada, several years prior.\n\nIn addition to Asner, Stapleton and Harrison, this ensemble cast includes several other recognizable actors: Stephanie Zimbalist, Gail Strickland, Lawrence Pressman, Veronica Hamel and Bruce Davison among others.\n\nGeneral \nDVDRip\nComplete name: The Gathering.avi \nFormat: AVI \nFormat/Info: Audio Video Interleave \nFile size: 1.39 GiB \nDuration: 1h 33mn \nOverall bit rate: 2 125 Kbps \nWriting library: VirtualDub build 32817/release \n\nVideo \nID: 0 \nFormat: MPEG-4 Visual \nFormat profile: Advanced Simple@L5 \nFormat settings, BVOP: 2 \nFormat settings, QPel: No \nFormat settings, GMC: No warppoints \nFormat settings, Matrix: Default (H.263) \nMuxing mode: Packed bitstream \nCodec ID: XVID \nCodec ID/Hint: XviD \nDuration: 1h 33mn \nBit rate: 1 922 Kbps \nWidth: 640 pixels \nHeight: 480 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio: 4:3 \nFrame rate: 29.970 fps \nColor space: YUV \nChroma subsampling: 4:2:0 \nBit depth: 8 bits \nScan type: Progressive \nCompression mode: Lossy \nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.209 \nStream size: 1.26 GiB (90%) \nWriting library: XviD 73 \n\nAudio \nID: 1 \nFormat: AC-3 \nFormat/Info: Audio Coding 3 \nMode extension: CM (complete main) \nFormat settings, Endianness: Big \nCodec ID: 2000 \nDuration: 1h 33mn \nBit rate mode: Constant \nBit rate: 192 Kbps \nChannel(s): 2 channels \nChannel positions: Front: L R \nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz \nBit depth: 16 bits \nCompression mode: Lossy \nStream size: 129 MiB (9%) \nAlignment: Aligned on interleaves \nInterleave, duration: 33 ms (1.00 video frame) \nInterleave, preload duration: 512 ms ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b7f2ddab0001a36c7030d6bbf386200b9fe62e9","amp;dn":"The+Gathering+%281977%29+-+Ed+Asner+%28Christmas+Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b7f2ddab0001a36c7030d6bbf386200b9fe62e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,127,45,218,176,0,26,54,199,3,13,107,191,56,98,0,185,254,98,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
