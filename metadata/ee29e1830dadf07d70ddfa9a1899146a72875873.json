But there hasn't been a collection as thorough as the 2004 double-disc set Greatest Hits. While the group had only one true U.S. hit (the perennial sporting event/barroom/rock radio anthem &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;), to pass Lizzy off as a one-hit wonder would be a major mistake. The band continued to thrive commercially in just about every other part of the world, and issued countless songs that should have followed &quot;Boys&quot; up the stateside charts, most of which are included on Greatest Hits. While one tiny gripe about the 36-track collection is that the tracks are not in chronological order, all the bases are covered -- early tracks (&quot;The Rocker,&quot; &quot;Wild One&quot;), guitar showdowns (&quot;Emerald,&quot; &quot;Black Rose,&quot; &quot;Bad Reputation&quot;), anthems (&quot;Jailbreak,&quot; &quot;Whiskey in the Jar,&quot; the aforementioned &quot;Boys&quot;), Phil Lynott's soft side (&quot;Sarah,&quot; &quot;Pariesiene Walkways,&quot; &quot;Dancing in the Moonlight&quot;), and rarities (selections from Lynott's solo albums, the single-only &quot;Trouble Boys,&quot; and a pair of previously unreleased live tracks). If you're a newcomer to Lizzy or curious to dig deeper than merely your weathered vinyl copy of Jailbreak, Greatest Hits is an essential purchase. Hard rock rarely gets better than this.
