Stars: Nathan Phillips, Cassandra Magrath, Kestie Morassi,John Jarratt  \n\n\nEnglish subtitle file is included in torrent\n\n\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:086505405f22403c8725984e70566736476537a1","amp;dn":"AUSTRALIAN+MOVIE+-+Wolf+Creek+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"086505405f22403c8725984e70566736476537a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,101,5,64,95,34,64,60,135,37,152,78,112,86,103,54,71,101,55,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
