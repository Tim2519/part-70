Please refer to the seed note for more details and installation instructions,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Apple tells developers who are enrolled with the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s annual seeding program.\n\n\n \nIn the seed note, Apple mentions the focus areas for this build. According to one person who is familiar with the matter, these areas include Mail, Messages, Graphics Drivers, VoiceOver, and VPN. There are no known issues with the software.\n\nApple Developer Program registrants can download OS X Mavericks 10.9.2 by using the OS X Seed utility from the Mac Dev Center (if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re installing an OS X beta for the first time), or via Software Update (if they already have an OS X Mavericks beta installed).\n\nApple reportedly tells developers, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you are using a computer which gets its updates from a local Software Update server, the OS X Software Update Seed Configuration Utility will reconfigure your machine to use Apple's Software Update servers.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Your computer must be able to connect to Apple's Software Update servers to install the seed. We recommend that you remove any Configuration Profile that specifies a local Software Update server before installing the OS X Software Update Seed Configuration Utility,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the company adds.\n\nAs always, the Cupertino giant specifically outlines that OS X 10.9.2 is being provided for testing and development purposes.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Should you encounter any problems, please submit a bug report using the online Bug Reporter at bugreporter.apple.com,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says the company.\n\nApple urges developers to be sure to include Ã¢â‚¬Å“10.9.2 (13C32)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the bug title and description, to ensure quick processing of any reported bugs.\nby http://www.osx86world.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:848b938f4042d36b8cf5145805fb311678b08531","amp;dn":"OSXUpdCombo10.9.2_13C32","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"848b938f4042d36b8cf5145805fb311678b08531","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,139,147,143,64,66,211,107,140,245,20,88,5,251,49,22,120,176,133,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
