Here he traces the food scene he reported on in America and abroad, from his pathbreaking dispatches on nouvelle cuisine chefs like Paul Bocuse and Michel GuÃƒÂ©rard in France to the rise of contemporary American food stars like Thomas Keller and Grant Achatz, and the fruitful collision of science and cooking in the kitchens of El Bulli in Spain, the Fat Duck outside London, and CopenhagenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gnarly Noma.\nSokolov invites readers to join him as a privileged observer of the most transformative period in the history of cuisine with this personal narrative of the sensual education of an accidental gourmet. We dine out with him at temples of haute cuisine like New YorkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s LutÃƒÂ¨ce but also at a pioneering outpost of Sichuan food in a gas station in New Jersey, at a raunchy Texas chili cookoff, and at a backwoods barbecue shack in Alabama, as well as at three-star restaurants from Paris to Las Vegas.\nSteal the Menu is, above all, an entertaining and engaging account of a tumultuous period of globalizing food ideas and frontier-crossing ingredients that produced the unprecedentedly rich and diverse way of eating we enjoy today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a5ea982da7f929a74db55cf4a1e0dd17b0acd47","amp;dn":"A+Memoir+of+Forty+Years+in+Food+By+Raymond+Sokolov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a5ea982da7f929a74db55cf4a1e0dd17b0acd47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,94,169,130,218,127,146,154,116,219,85,207,74,30,13,209,123,10,205,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
