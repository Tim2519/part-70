The basis of a groundbreaking, award-winning documentary film, it remains the gold standard of Hollywood storytelling.\n\nThe only actor ever to run a Hollywood studio, Evans emerged from near-obscurity in the mid-1960s to rescue Paramount, one of the great studios of the Golden Age, from near-bankruptcy. A self-confessed &quot;half-assed actor,&quot; Evans proved a genius producer and studio chief, drawing on his irresistible combination of instinct, smarts, showmanship, and bravado to take Paramount from the basement to the penthouse with such films as The Odd Couple, Rosemary's Baby, Love Story, The Godfather, and Chinatown. He lived a swashbuckling life, partying with lifetime friends like Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, and Dustin Hoffman, consulting with power players like Henry Kissinger, and squiring a host of dazzling women including his wives Ali McGraw, Catherine Oxenberg, and Phyllis George. After a decade of triumph, he lost everything in a spectacular flameout of cocaine and bad business decisions, yet survived it allÃ¢â‚¬â€and lived to tell the tale.\n\nAn extraordinary raconteur, Evans spares no one, least of all himself. Filled with starring roles for everyone from Ava Gardner to Marlon Brando to Sharon Stone, The Kid Stays in the Picture is sharp, witty, and self-aggrandizing and self-lacerating in equal measure.\n\nThis new It Books edition, the first in more than a decade, will feature a new foreword by the author. And simultaneous with this edition will come a first-ever ebook rolloutÃ¢â‚¬â€including both a regular edition and an enhanced ebook with clips from Evans's celebrated, Grammy-nominated audiobook and the famous 2002 documentary.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aacc13dce348640cb98f7ed1d63f268635266b92","amp;dn":"The+Kid+Stays+in+the+Picture+-+Robert+Evans.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aacc13dce348640cb98f7ed1d63f268635266b92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,204,19,220,227,72,100,12,185,143,126,209,214,63,38,134,53,38,107,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
