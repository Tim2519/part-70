The album became the band's breakthrough hit, reaching #2 in the UK charts and #17 in the US, making it the most successful Free album. The album contained the hit single &quot;All Right Now&quot; which they later played to a crowd of over 600,000 people at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, generating great popularity. To date, it is the only Free album to have seen a CD reissue in America.\n\nIn 2001 the album was reissued with extra tracks, consisting only of alternate versions of songs already on the album. They include an alternate vocal take of &quot;Oh I Wept&quot; and a remix of &quot;Fire and Water&quot; to correct many of the production deficiencies that the original contains. This version of the song does not fade out; instead Simon Kirke's final drum solo is performed to the end resulting in this version being twenty-one seconds longer than the album version. A BBC Session of this song is also included.\n\nFree was an English rock band formed in London in 1968 best known for their 1970 signature song &quot;All Right Now&quot;. They disbanded in 1973 and lead singer Paul Rodgers went on to become a frontman of the band Bad Company along with Simon Kirke on drums. Lead guitarist Paul Kossoff formed Back Street Crawler and died from a drug-induced heart failure at the age of 25 in 1976. Bassist Andy Fraser formed Sharks.\n\nThe band was famed for its sensational live shows and nonstop touring. However, early studio albums did not sell very well Ã¢â‚¬â€œ until the release of Fire and Water which featured the massive hit &quot;All Right Now&quot;. The song helped secure them a place at the huge Isle of Wight Festival 1970 where they played to 600,000 people.\n\nBy the early 1970s, Free was one of the biggest-selling British blues-rock groups; by the time the band dissolved in 1973, they had sold more than 20 million albums around the world and had played more than 700 arena and festival concerts. &quot;All Right Now,&quot; remains a rock staple, and had been entered into ASCAP's &quot;One Million&quot; airplay singles club.\n\nRolling Stone has referred to the band as &quot;British hard rock pioneers&quot;. The magazine ranked Rodgers No. 55 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;, while Kossoff was ranked No. 51 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_and_Water_(Free_album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_and_Water_(Free_album)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/IaEFiaafK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/IaEFiaafK&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 9640kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:52\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
