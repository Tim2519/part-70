It doesn't take a prophecy scholar to recognize the deteriorating situation in the Middle East. CNN is already talking about a coming battle for Jerusalem as if they invented the idea. In fact, the spiritual battle for Jerusalem has already begun! What is the conflict really all about? Learn who really owns Jerusalem. Is the Mosque really the third holiest site in Islam? Will either side ever compromise? Find out what's behind the headlines, and why the truth never makes it to Page One. Join Hal Lindsey and Cliff Ford as they explain what's at the heart of the Middle East conflict, and WHY THE WEST WILL NEVER SOLVE IT.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHeritage Of Israel:\nRekindling the Reformation by Walter Veith...\nTradition holds that those who are born of the sons of Abraham can receive salvation by this merit alone. There are many people who claim to be from the tribes of Israel. This DVD examines this belief in light of Scripture. What was the purpose of Israel? Does salvation come through the Jewish nation? Is salvation even possible through birthright? The meaning of the Jewish feasts is also examined, along with the question of the name of Jesus.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWho Is Israel: Gods Country\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSigns - Part 35:\nA compilation of various short clips presenting the apocalyptic signs which are occurring around the world today and help us identify the state of affairs ushering the end of days.  View what's been happening in our time and determine for yourself the onset of Revelations and what may lay ahead.  \nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series at http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41 ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
