We will then sketch out our creature's bone structure, which will be the foundation for the body and skin painting process. Next we will focus on creating line work, a foundational grayscale, and then add color and details. Finally, we will then create custom brushes specific to the image, and play with photo-textures.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial we will have created a fully rendered Sci-Fi creature and learned new painting processes along the way!\n\n\nTutor for this course: Alex Alvarado\n\nAlex Alvarado is a Concept Artist for Star Team LLC in Burbank, California.
