Rachel and Gene discover that he's alive, much to their shock. Aaron begins to believe that the nanites were responsible for bringing him back to life. Meanwhile, Miles is held captive by Titus Andover and his tribe members. The holding area contains a red door where no prisoner returns from. Meanwhile, the town discovers that the sheriff is dead and Miles is held captive. Rachel tries to organize a rescue for Miles, but no one agrees, eventually leading to trying to rescue him on her own. While Rachel is leaving the town, Gene and the others join in. Miles tries to escape, but gets caught instead. He is brought before Titus Andover, who after revealing his history, smashes Miles' right hand with a hammer. It is revealed later that a key member of TitusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ group is actually a Patriot. Back at Willoughby, Aaron reveals to his girlfriend Cynthia the truth behind the Blackout and his resurrection. Meanwhile, Charlie discovers that MonroeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s abductors are contracted by the Patriots, after being captured by the pair. The lead, Adam, notes that the Patriots need Monroe alive. The pair let Charlie go, and ride off with Monroe, only to have Monroe flee in an escape. Charlie manages to save Adam but not his partner. In Savannah, Neville organizes an assassination attempt on Allenford, only to turn on the would-be assassin to further his goal of infiltrating the Patriots. At the tent, Allenford allows Neville to join the Patriots. The episode closes as Miles is brought behind the red door where Titus is next to a sick woman who is receiving a blood transfusion from a dead man lying on a table nearby.\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4feed6d1c8c0d006e31520b7d6d460a857aad961","amp;dn":"Revolution.2012.S02E02.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4feed6d1c8c0d006e31520b7d6d460a857aad961","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,238,214,209,200,192,208,6,227,21,32,183,214,212,96,168,87,170,217,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
