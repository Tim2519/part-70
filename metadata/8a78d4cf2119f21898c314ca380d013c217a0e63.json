Now summer stretches before her with nowhere to go but home, at least until itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to go back to medical school.\nDetermined to prove she might be down but definitely not out, she chucks all her old plans in favor of having a good timeÃ¢â‚¬â€starting with giving herself a pair of wings. Tattooed wings, that is, in the form of a phoenix on her back.\nWhen everyone else at Dermamania chickens out at the prospect of putting the gorgeous, perfect skin of the bossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s big sister under the needle, Ian Rhodes finds himself stepping up. Then unexpectedly connecting with her through tears that have nothing to do with the pain of getting inked.\nAttraction flares into one hot night that was supposed to stay that wayÃ¢â‚¬â€single, and secret. But best laid plans have a way of getting blown out of the water. Now two perfect strangers must plan for a very different futureÃ¢â‚¬Â¦beginning with whether thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enough common ground to spend it together.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a78d4cf2119f21898c314ca380d013c217a0e63","amp;dn":"Take+Me+On+by+Cherrie+Lynn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a78d4cf2119f21898c314ca380d013c217a0e63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,120,212,207,33,25,242,24,152,195,20,202,56,13,1,60,33,122,14,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
