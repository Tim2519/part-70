Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&amp;B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Knowles' debut album Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a viable solo artist worldwide; it sold 11 million copies, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard number one singles &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy&quot;.\n\nFollowing the disbandment of Destiny's Child in 2005, she released her second solo album, B'Day (2006), which contained hits &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Liar&quot;. Knowles also ventured into acting, with a Golden Globe nominated performance in Dreamgirls (2006), and starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006) and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay-Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which saw the birth of her alter-ego Sasha Fierce and earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Song of the Year for &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot;. Knowles took a hiatus from music in 2010, took over management of her career and explored 1970s R&amp;B, rock and roll, and African and funk styles. As a result, her subsequent albums, 4 (2011) and BeyoncÃƒÂ© (2013), deviated towards a more experimental sound.\n\nA self-described &quot;modern-day feminist&quot;,[5] Knowles' songs are often characterized by themes of love, relationships and monogamy, as well as female sexuality and empowerment. On stage, her dynamic, highly-choreographed performances have led to critics hailing her as one of the best entertainers in contemporary popular music. Throughout a career spanning 15 years, she has won 17 Grammy Awards and sold over 118 million records as a solo artist[6] and 60 million with Destiny's Child,[7] making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[8][9] The Recording Industry Association of America recognized Knowles as the Top Certified Artist in America during the 2000s decade.[10][11] In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade,[12] the Top Female Artist of the 2000s and their Artist of the Millennium.[13][14] In 2013, she was also included in Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eee63218b984c2ce52dad1bf225fc62fe5053508","amp;dn":"BEYONC%26Eacute%3B+-+Beyonc%26eacute%3B+%5B2013%5D+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eee63218b984c2ce52dad1bf225fc62fe5053508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,230,50,24,185,132,194,206,82,218,209,191,34,95,198,47,229,5,53,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
