Who knew? It is a classic as much as the Bing Crosby and the Charlie Brown Christmas albums are. The real tragedy is that it is a rare and obscure title. You can't really blame people because they don't know that Glen Close can not only hold her own with a world renown opera singer, but has a voice that is truly amazing, clear and bright over an orchestra and chorus. Why hasn't she produced other albums? The orchestra, chorus and recording are superb, every song is wonderful with &quot;Ding Dong Merrily on High&quot; an incredible finish. It's a crime they didn't make a DVD out of the performance.\n\nIf I ever meet Glen Close I won't gush over her outstanding acting, it will be for producing a classic, and my favorite, Christmas album which I listen to, over and over, every December. If you like full throated, joyous classic Christmas music,[/quote] ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91553dfcd660729e89c17cba1aa58da4801efa23","amp;dn":"Glenn+Close+%26amp%3B+Placido+Domingo+-+Repeat+the+Sounding+Joy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91553dfcd660729e89c17cba1aa58da4801efa23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,85,61,252,214,96,114,158,137,193,124,186,26,165,141,164,128,30,250,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
