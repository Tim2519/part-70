The show was based in the Watts section of Los Angeles where the mom was the single parent with two children in the household. The show itself was side-splitting hilarious indeed catching the gang down at the soda stop coming up with some crazy scheme or another, and catching Rerun and Shirley (the waitress) battling it out, or getting some girl to go out with them. The show was a major top ten hit for the ABC network. Worth watching though. Classic. \n\nThe show changed significantly in the third season, most notably with Roger and Rerun moving into their own apartment. Mabel King &quot;Mama&quot; left the show due to creative differences, but the character of Mama was not written out. Instead characters said that Mama was working or not around. To provide an adult presence in the house for Dee, Shirley moved in to the Thomas household as a boarder. Several new recurring characters were introduced. The first was a basketball player whom Roger tutored nicknamed &quot;The Snake&quot;. The other characters were detective &quot;Big Earl&quot; Barnett and his son &quot;Little Earl&quot; Barnett, who were neighbors in the apartment building where Roger and Rerun lived.\n\n(Quality note on episode 10 &quot;Positive Identification&quot;. There are camera angles that produce a wobbly image. The episode is like that on the DVD.)\n\nScreenshots - \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3f3f988128428e185ebc9e24e181a904839b40b","amp;dn":"What%27s+Happening%21%21+Season+3+%28fiveofseven%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3f3f988128428e185ebc9e24e181a904839b40b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,243,249,136,18,132,40,225,133,235,201,226,78,24,26,144,72,57,180,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
