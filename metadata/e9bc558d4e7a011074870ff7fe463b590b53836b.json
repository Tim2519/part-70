Cauis Merlyn Britannicus is responsible for their safety, and all look to him for guidance, leadership, justice, and salvation. It is a harsh life but a good community, and Merlyn is dedicated to spreading the influence of Roman culture beyond the ColonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s borders.\nUther Pendragon, the man who will father the legendary Arthur, is the cousin Merlyn has known and loved since they were birthed, four hours apart on the same day, the year the legions left Britain. He is the tireless warrior - the red dragon to MerlynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great silver bear - and between the two of them, the Colony knows few enemies.\nAs different as they can be, they are inseparable: two faces of the same coin. In a world torn apart by warfare and upheaval, each is the otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certainty and guarantee of the survival of the Colony...until a vicious crime, one that strikes at the roots of MerlynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, drives a wedge between them. A wedge that threatens the fate of a nation....\n\nGeneral\n\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nOverall bit rate mode : Constant\nOverall bit rate : 64.0 Kbps\n\n\nAudio\n\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 40.0 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 1 channel\nSampling rate : 16.0 KHz\n\nEncoded by : sum1 here","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9bc558d4e7a011074870ff7fe463b590b53836b","amp;dn":"The+Eagles%27+Brood+Camulod+Chronicles%2C+Book+3+%28AudioBook%29+-+sum1_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9bc558d4e7a011074870ff7fe463b590b53836b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,188,85,141,78,122,1,16,116,135,15,247,254,70,59,89,11,83,131,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
