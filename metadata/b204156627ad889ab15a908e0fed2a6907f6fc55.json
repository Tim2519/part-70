It sat at #1 for 5 weeks, from July 31, 1999 to August 28, 1999. With her beautiful debut, Christina was indeed released and unleashed.\n\nIt was indeed number one when the band played the song on The Tonight Show for real and keeps behind her. Christina Dancer sang and moved till she thrilled and killed one and all before her, with a final vocal fireworks display that left no doubt the girl had won the world on one hot damn August Friday night.\n\nThe exact date is unknown. I can't find the performance on youtube. The appearance is not even listed in IMDB. Unforgivable since it is so undeniably genius.\n\nWhen 'The Voice' sits down to talk with Jay, she even pays tribute to her childhood inspiration, the same the woman who saved my adult life: Julie Andrews. That's another story for another time, but just so there's that, too.\n\n______________________________\n\nScreencaps by Capt.
