Martin P. Keerns. (2013)\n\n Greetings my fellow truth seeker. My name is Martin Keerns, I have passionately researched, compiled, and edited the following series of books for you with much love, care, and dedication over the last 5 years. - Thousands of hours of demanding work went into what you are about to read. \n\n I take great pleasure in finally being able to present to you this the first section of my work: - Hopefully this will have been for your benefit first of all, but perhaps also just a little bit for your pleasure. (As you will discover if you read this, I have quite a wicked and very dry sense of humour). \n\n These first four books when taken together make up just one small part of a meganormously extensive four part series of work that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve dubbed the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grand Unified Theory SeriesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nThis initial section has been titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Notice of IntentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (This is for a number of reasons that will become abundantly clear to anyone who does bother to read it all the way through).\n\n This section deals with a whole range of issues, ALL concerning one thing in particular - CONTROL.\n\n Part One - Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sex, Drugs, Rock and KontrolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ The first book looks at social control, being enforced through mind control, largely for the purpose of population control. I also lay out hundreds of pages of very hard hitting no-punches-pulled information, (including some quite rare or Ã¢â‚¬Å“hard to come byÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ articles) on a subject that REALLY rips my knitting more than anything else. - Organised paedophilia.\n\n Part Two - Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dumbed down word controlled monkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s who think that keeping up with the JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and not being the stupidest guy or gal in the room is ALL that really mattersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ concentrates on the multi-faceted and ubiquitous methods of mind control that are routinely being used on entire populations by our wanabee owners to train, manipulate, condition, and herd, (yet at the same time alienate us from each other) every single day of our lives from the womb to the cold dark tomb. \n\n Part Three - Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Needle and the Damage DoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ this third part of the section quite literally bulges to the point of bursting trying to contain all of the crucial facts detailing all the different Ã¢â‚¬Å“weaponsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that are being utilised by the small group of rich, influential psychoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (who we allow to be in charge) who collectively are doing EVERYTHING they can to limit our numbers using population control. \n\n Part Four - To end the first section we have Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Random Collection of Conspiracy Facts for One to Theorise OnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which demonstrates the truly endemic nature of all this control that I have been highlighting in the previous three works. There are subjects that could have been included in the earlier parts but that ultimately didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it solely because I tried to maintain Ã¢â‚¬Å“themesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the earlier books. - But that has absolutely no bearing on their quality, (in fact my first chapter on the moon landings, in my own honest, humble, and modest opinion, nails this subject better than any other individual has done on their own before me). The second half of the book also seriously examines, in great detail, money, banking, and world finance in general for some 500 odd pages.\n I saw which way the wind was blowing before I ever started this project, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve known right from day one that it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be too long a period of time before our would be owners would find ways to limit our access to the treasure trove of information that is Ã¢â‚¬Å“the netÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Blocking sites, disappearing sites (articles and books), subscription only access to newspaper archives - these have all proven my hunch to be right. That is why all of my books contain hundreds of these articles in their entirety. They also contain loads of diagrams, charts, graphs, pictures, and the original documents that I cite. \n\n This was always intended to be a comprehensive reference work from its inception (which is why the books are each on average something like 900 pages long). This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a quick concise opinion or two:\n This is truly a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grand Unified TheoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nEnjoy, and please do make an effort to share. Much Love to you all. Your good friend Martin Keerns.\n\n Part Two: Dumbed down word controlled monkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s who think that keeping up with the JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and not being the stupidest guy or gal in the room is ALL that really matters.\n\n Introduction, Preamble and legal/lawful disclaimer - Pages 1 to 2 Contents - Pages 4 to 5\n\n Chapter Seventeen - Pages 7 to 43 Me welcoming you to this part of my work, and some really useful information on an incredibly interesting, yet for some reason, rather overlooked part of Germany.\n\n Chapter Eighteen - Pages 45 to 143 Psychiatry an Industry of Death. That title says it all really. Take a historical tour with me that chronicles the development of this insane field of Ã¢â‚¬Å“ScienceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also some extremely pertinent information on sociopaths and psychopaths for you to consider.\n\n Chapter Nineteen - Pages 145 to 208 Psychiatric drugs, psychopathic drugs companies. Here we look at the standard of treatment administered by these people. We also look at their aims for the young and old.\n\n Chapter Twenty - Pages 210 to 274 An overview of some of Mind ControlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s major milestones and also a brief section on a Ã¢â‚¬Å“greatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ British institution that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve maybe never heard of: - The Tavistock Institute.\n\n Chapter Twenty One - Pages 276 to 307 Transcripts of The Napa Valley Sentinel series on Mind Control.\n\n Chapter Twenty Two - Pages 309 to 350 Some shocking information on The False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF), also, just what are Disassociative Identity Disorder (DID) and Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD)?\n\n Chapter Twenty Three - Pages 352 to 419 Excerpts from Dave McGowanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Programmed to KillÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Here my favourite author demonstrates to you quite clearly Ã¢â‚¬Å“The powers that beÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ created serial killing to keep you fearful. - And also to find something for their assassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to do while theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not at work.\n\n Chapter Twenty Four - Pages 421 to 472 Jonestown and Dunblane. Here we find out that this total control of the mind of another not only works on individuals, it also works on large groups of people, even whole countries.\n\n Chapter Twenty Five - Pages 474 to 552 In this chapter we cover the control of the media and how Mind Control came into the home through good old TV and the newspapers, - hopefully in the process youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also have the brains work out why you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t already been hearing about any of the things I talk of.\n\n Chapter Twenty Six - Pages 554 to 584 Think twice before you complain about your kid not doing the washing up...Because if your kid is just like any other, then your child is probably in their bedroom right now training to be a ruthless assassin on their Playstation or Xbox.\n\n Chapter Twenty Seven - Pages 586 to 596 A short introduction (that re-introduces an old Ã¢â‚¬Å“friendÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and an equally short yet succinct chronology detailing the systematic implementation of compulsory education in the USA.\n\n Chapter Twenty Eight - Pages 598 to 651 The Ã¢â‚¬Å“FoundationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of our modern day education system part 1.\n\n Chapter Twenty Nine - Pages 653 to 675 The Ã¢â‚¬Å“FoundationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of our modern day education system part 2.\n\n Chapter Thirty - Pages 677 to 740 The proof of the deliberate dumbing down of society using education. This chapter begins with an exam a 13/14 year old child had to pass a century ago to get into high school. NOT ONE OF YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PASS IT TODAY - THAT INCLUDES YOUR KIDSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ TEACHERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S, THEIR TEACHERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S, AND PROBABLY MOST UNIVERSITY PROFESSORÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S TOO!\n\n Chapter Thirty One - Pages 742 to 781 To end the work I briefly touch upon a subject that was brought up in Chapter Nineteen that conveniently provides a perfect segue to the next part of the work. - Genetic Heritability.
