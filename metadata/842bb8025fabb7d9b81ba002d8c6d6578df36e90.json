Unlike American Idols' lengthy audition process, the celebrity mentors will select their team members via a blind audition, so they'll only be able to hear their voices. The show will have three stages of competition-the blind audition, a battle phase, and the live performance shows. Viewers will take part in the show by casting votes to help determine the finalists, who are competing for the grand prizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œa recording contract.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:842bb8025fabb7d9b81ba002d8c6d6578df36e90","amp;dn":"The.Voice.S05E22E23.HDTV.x264-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"842bb8025fabb7d9b81ba002d8c6d6578df36e90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,43,184,2,95,171,183,217,184,27,160,2,216,198,214,87,141,243,110,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
