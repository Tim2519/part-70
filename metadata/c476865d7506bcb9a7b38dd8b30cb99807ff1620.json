In essence, it is a love story and a marvelously insightful account of their years together, beginning with their initial meeting when Fraser was the wife of a member of Parliament and mother of six, and Pinter was married to a distinguished actress. Over the years, they experienced much joy, a shared devotion to their work, crises and laughter, and, in the end, great courage and love as Pinter battled the illness to which he eventually sucÃ‚Â­cumbed on Christmas Eve 2008.\n\nMust You Go? is based on FraserÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recollections and on the diaries she has kept since October 1968. She shares PinterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own revelations about his past, as well as observations by his friends. FraserÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s diariesÃ¢â‚¬â€written by a biographer living with a creative artist and observing the process firsthandÃ¢â‚¬â€also proÃ‚Â­vide a unique insight into his writing.\n\nHarold Pinter and Antonia Fraser lived together from August 1975 until his death thirty-three years later. Ã¢â‚¬Å“O! call back yesterday, bid time return,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ cries one of the courtiers to Richard II. This is Antonia FraserÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uniquely compelling way of doing so.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c476865d7506bcb9a7b38dd8b30cb99807ff1620","amp;dn":"Must+You+Go+-+My+Life+with+Harold+Pinter-+Antonia+Fraser.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c476865d7506bcb9a7b38dd8b30cb99807ff1620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,118,134,93,117,6,188,185,167,179,141,216,179,12,185,152,7,255,22,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
