As the headline performers at a sold-out Radio City Music Hall, they helped raise funds for the FoundationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s international initiative to teach one million at-risk children to meditateÃ¢â‚¬â€and to begin to change their world from within.\n\nMany other world-famous musiciansÃ¢â‚¬â€Sheryl Crow, Donovan, Eddie Vedder, Moby, Ben Harper, Paul Horn, Angelo Badalamenti, Betty LaVette, and Jim JamesÃ¢â‚¬â€joined the two remaining Beatles to thrill the crowd as well, as did Jerry Seinfeld in a brilliant guest performance. Between acts, David Lynch showed powerful film clips of meditating students in Foundation schools, Institute director Dr. John Hagelin summarized the compelling TM research, and celebrity personalities Howard Stern, Russell Simmons, Mike Love of the Beach Boys, and Laura Dern spoke passionately about the benefits of TM practice.\n\nIn addition to superb individual performances, the musicians at the concert sang together on many songs and created a powerful, joyful onstage camaraderie and unity, with everyone committed to bringing meditation to students everywhere and helping the youth reach their full potential.\n\nAll 6,000 tickets for the concert had sold out immediately upon availability, with many leaders of society, celebrities, and wealthy philanthropists in attendance, including Yoko Ono, Olivia Harrison, John McEnroe, Martin Scorsese, Matthew Broderick, Jennifer Aniston, Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini, David Arquette, Michael J. Fox, and Bill OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly.\n\nDr. Hagelin, the Institute staff, and the InstituteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highly effective and experienced media team, led by visionary media director Bob Roth, worked nonstop for months to organize the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Change Begins WithinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ concert and to generate unprecedented media coverage for it. To maximize the media impact of the concert, Paul, Ringo, and other performers joined David Lynch for a rare live pre-concert press conference on April 3, connecting via webcast with local press conferences in all major U.S. cities across the nation.\nwww.DavidLynchFoundation.org\n\n01.
