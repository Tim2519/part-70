She is energetic, curious, and a bit oddÃ¢â‚¬â€odd enough to be called strange by her father as well as ignorant of many things that even a five-year-old should know. Because of this, the most ordinary experience can become an adventure for her. As the days progress, she makes new friends and shows those around her that every day can be enjoyable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec24d4d23817dfb0c1e9894fcc4fc4bed6d76afa","amp;dn":"Yotsubato%21+-+Vol.+06","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec24d4d23817dfb0c1e9894fcc4fc4bed6d76afa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,36,212,210,56,23,223,176,193,233,137,79,204,79,196,190,214,215,106,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
