Sometimes being really clever can work. Sometimes fans can be smart enough to let the material speak for itself and not try to lead it around. Sometimes, as is the case with Dark Knight Project, they had and actual budget and money to work with. Sometimes, by God, they have honest talent.\n\nNow, in this review IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve said some harsh things about fan films, and I sadly mean them. Fan films always try too damn hard to be cool. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re like porn, except with fistfights replacing sex. Dark Knight Project succeeds specifically because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very low key. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s basically two high school kids walking out at night trying to capture Batman on tape for a school project. The timeframe is a little before Dark Knight when Batman has got all the criminals on edge and the Joker has just begun to make himself known.\n\nKnow why else it works? Because it feels real, it feels like what two high school kids living in the actual world of Batman would think and say. Does Batman exist? Maybe heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a story the cops cooked up to scare crooks? You never know. The film wisely treats Batman as this intriguing mystery/conspiracy and the thoughts the kids have about him feel genuine.\n\nTell you what; IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll give this film the best and most apt compliment I can give it: If this short was an extra on Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Dark KnightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ DVD as a real canonical bridge between Begins and Knight, it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be out of place at all. It works. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great attention to detail here to try and match the mood and pacing of NolanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Batman films&quot;\n\nRead more: http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/11556/\n\n\nFiles:\n\nTHE DARK KNIGHT PROJECT DVD.iso\n\nTDKP_DISC_FACE.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ced16747862d753a33d37e2efcf8d6c6ae89e4a","amp;dn":"The+Dark+Knight+Project+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ced16747862d753a33d37e2efcf8d6c6ae89e4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,237,22,116,120,98,215,83,163,61,55,226,239,207,141,108,106,232,158,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
