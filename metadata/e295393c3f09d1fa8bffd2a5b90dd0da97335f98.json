I first visited the U.S. Capitol 6 years ago as a 16 year-old, high school exchange student and later to brief congressional staffers on issues related to Yemen. It is a tremendous honor for me to return to the United States Senate to testify today. \n \nMy name is Farea Al-Muslimi. I am from Wessab, a remote mountain village in Yemen, about nine hoursÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ drive from my countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capital, SanaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢a. Most of the world has never heard of Wessab. But just six days ago, my village was struck by a drone, in an attack that terrified thousands of simple, poor farmers. The drone strike and its impact tore my heart, much as the tragic bombings in Boston last week tore your hearts and also mine. \n \nI have visited locations where U.S. targeted killing strikes have hit their intended targets. And I have visited sites where the U.S. strikes missed their targets and instead killed or injured innocent civilians. I have spoken with grieving family members and angry villagers. I have seen Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (Ã¢â‚¬Å“AQAPÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) use U.S. strikes to promote its agenda and try to recruit more terrorists. \n \nI am here today to talk about the human costs and consequences of targeted killing by the United States in Yemen. \n\n...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e295393c3f09d1fa8bffd2a5b90dd0da97335f98","amp;dn":"%5B2013%5D+Drone+Wars+-+The+Constitutional+and+Counterterrorism+Impl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e295393c3f09d1fa8bffd2a5b90dd0da97335f98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,149,57,60,63,9,209,250,139,255,210,165,185,13,208,218,151,51,95,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
