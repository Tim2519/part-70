Edward Griffin, author of the definitive book on the bankster cartel operation masquerading as a federal agency, The Creature from Jekyll Island. \n\nAlex also covers the idiocy of Americans brawling over Air Jordan sneakers during this festive holiday and the ongoing Phil Robertson and Duck Dynasty skirmish in the culture war. \n\nAlso on today's worldwide broadcast, Alex talks with constitutional lawyer and author Bruce Fein about the Obama administration's move toward dictatorship and unaccountability to the American people. Fein is the author of American Empire Before the Fall and Constitutional Peril: The Life and Death Struggle for Our Constitution and Democracy.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
