Ranging from 1942, when the British suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the Empire, through the crucial battles of Imphal and Kohima (&quot;the Stalingrad of the East&quot;), and on to ultimate victory in 1945, this account is vivid, brutal, and enthralling.\nFrank McLynn opens a new window on the Burma Campaign, focusing on the interactions and antagonisms of its principal players: William Slim, the brilliant general commanding the British 14th Army; Orde Wingate, the ambitious and idiosyncratic commander of the Chindits, a British force of irregulars; Louis Mountbatten, one of Churchill's favorites, overpromoted to the position of Supreme Commander, S.E. Asia; and Joseph Stilwell (&quot;Vinegar Joe&quot;), a hard-line U.S. general, also a martinet and Anglophobe. McLynn draws careful portraits of each of these men, neglecting neither strengths nor flaws, and shows with new clarity how the plans, designs, and strategies of generals and politicians were translated into a hideous reality for soldiers on the ground.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;The China-Burma-India Theater is one of the most overlooked and least understoodÃ¢â‚¬â€at least for Americans. McLynn traces the complex dance of the four main military actors (Vinegar Joe Stillwell, Bill Slim, Orde Wingate, and Lord Mountbatten) through brutal jungle logistics and battles.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€World War II Magazine\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This is fine history, well-written and absorbing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€John Linsenmeyer, Greenwich Times\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This is in my judgment the best survey of the south Asian campaign in existence. . . . The work is original, well researched, and provocative without being polemical.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Dennis Showalter, Colorado College\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A highly opinionated history of the bloody, half-forgotten World War II jungle campaign.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Kirkus Reviews\n\nWon Honorable Mention in the 2012 New York Book Festival History category, sponsored by the New York Book Festival\n(History Honorable Mention New York Book Festival 2012-06-12)\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nFrank McLynn is a highly regarded historian who specializes in biographies and military history.
