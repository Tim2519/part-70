Fortunately, that hasn't distracted attention from the bawdy, sassy vocals of Ann Rabson and Gaye Adegbalola, who still exhibit a raw, natural charisma. And the material -- which ranges from fresh interpretations of warhorses from Louis Jordan and Hank Williams to clever originals -- is all first-rate, helping make the album one of the group's best efforts.
