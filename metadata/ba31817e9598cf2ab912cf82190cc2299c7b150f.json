This time he deals with the subject of cops gone bad, including an account of one cop that made the FBI's ten most wanted list for a brutal, quadruple murder. It's hard to believeÃ¢â‚¬â€and readÃ¢â‚¬â€about so many police officers that fall from grace and make every mistake possible: theft, murder, fraud, drug abuse, and more. Not to mention the cops sent to prison, proving that &quot;anyone is capable of anything given the right circumstances.&quot; Get a rare insider's look at what cops rarely talk aboutÃ¢â‚¬â€true accounts of cops gone bad. It's a ride on the dark side of law enforcement you won't forget.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba31817e9598cf2ab912cf82190cc2299c7b150f","amp;dn":"Hero+To+Zero%2C+2nd+edition+By+Zach+Fortier","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba31817e9598cf2ab912cf82190cc2299c7b150f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,49,129,126,149,152,207,42,185,18,207,130,25,12,194,41,156,123,21,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
