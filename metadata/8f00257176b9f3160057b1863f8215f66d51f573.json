Why would their father leave them frozen? How is cryonic suspension even possible? Why doesn't the world know about the process fifty years later? How will the Emersons ever fit into the 21st century world of cell phones and microwave dinners? And why does it feel like they're all suddenly being followed?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f00257176b9f3160057b1863f8215f66d51f573","amp;dn":"Frozen+in+Time+-+Ali+Sparkes.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f00257176b9f3160057b1863f8215f66d51f573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,0,37,113,118,185,243,22,0,87,177,134,63,130,21,246,109,81,245,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
