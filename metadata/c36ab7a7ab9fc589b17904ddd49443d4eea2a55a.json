Ken Peters had dreams about end-time and tribulation in 1980. His dream greatly disturbed him, as he had no biblical knowledge of end times, the second coming of Christ or Tribulation. A few week after the dream, he accept Jesus as his savior. (Notice how much of this prophecy has already begun!)\n\nThe last part of video have prophecies. This is summary of prophecies;\n\nFuture Events\n1. All countries the US entered outside of God's will, God has considered encroachment and will allow these nations to afflict the US.\n\n2. The US has until the end of 2003 to change it's course back to God, if it fails to do so God will judge the US as a goat nation. America's determined time. [ ^ Events surrounding this prophecy.]\n\n3. Judgment will begin soon on unrepentant cities, regional blessing or judgment. (Psalm 110:1-3)\n\n4. Blessing of revival and harvest to regions responsive to Holy Spirit direction to bring unity and love to cities. (Daniel 11:32-35)\n\n5. Time of Aligning of the nations.

Africa and South America will be born-again Nations, &quot;Nations for Jesus&quot;.\n\n8. America's debauchery ruled regions will see more judgment. The homosexual agenda will launch an all out attack with open opposition to Christianity.\n\n9. America will adopt &quot;new laws and times&quot;. We must pray to stop this!\n\n10. The church will loose it's non-tax status.\n\n11. More leaders will come under national exposure until God brings forth a Righteous Church, clean without spot or blemish. (1 Peter 4:16-19)\n\n12.

Get out of the system of Babylon. Gad and Meni gods of prosperity and destiny. (Isaiah 65:8-15)\n\n3. Return to your first love; Jesus. Not His word, prophecy, or gifts - but Him. (Rev 2:2-5)\n\n4. Love your neighbor, avoid the spirit of intolerance and hatred.\n\n5. Don't run after signs or you will be deceived. Tear down idolatry. NOW!\n\n6. Begin to fast and pray, sanctify yourselves now, don't be foolish virgins.\n\n7. Put assets into Gold and Silver.\n\n8. Avoid slick technology that gives away your personal power.\n\n9. Don't fail to study God's word, keep your path lit. (2 Tim 2:15)\n\n10. Continually stand in the Gap. Repent as did Daniel and God will hear. (2 Chr 7:14)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Modern RCC in Christian Persecution:\nHistory Repeats! The most unreported war covers the most ignored news story, the persecution of Christians worldwide and its dramatic increase in the 21st century. Unbeknownst to many, the worst persecution that has been inflicted upon Christians is not by secular governments, but by people who profess to believe in God. Quite shocking to many, when the Catholic Church was in its prime, it committed the worst horrors in history, but has cleverly covered its track and as she begins to grow in influence, if she reclaims the former control she had over the governments in the Dark Ages, she will do it all over again.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPERSECUTION ON CHRISTIANS:\nA mini-5th Seal is being opened. Events will worsen as they progress toward End-Times. The tables are set and this video shows how these events have begun to shape and will harshen arpund the world in an uncompromising fashion against Christianity.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUNDER ATTACK (Persecution in the west) - Are you ready for what's coming?\nIt is coming, It is almost here! your city, your town, it is coming to your own back yard.\nWe thought as long as it finds it's victims somewhere else we are okay, we never really paid to much attention to the fact that so many Christians are suffering in other parts of the world where the persecution is so bad that many pay with their very lives.\nPersecution has an unquenchable desire for the blood of saints, hatred, control and pain are it's motives, to destroy and try to silence the truth is it's goal and it is never satisfied. Persecution many times waits for the leaders of a nation to become corrupt before it moves in to strike it's victims with it's venom.\nJesus said himself that if the world hates you to remember that it hated him first, we have lived in such a free society that the church has forgotten that we are not of this world. The world loves it's own and if you are a true believer in Jesus Christ at some point you are going to see just how much this world hates you!\nIf you don't believe me take my challenge and speak out against sin and you will quickly find out that this world does not love you.\nThe reason why is because you are standing for good and against evil, you are speaking truth but people don't want to hear the truth, they want their ears tickled with lies and sorry to say even from preachers in pulpit.\nIn the last days the bible says that brother will turn against brother, father against son, everyone will hate you if you follow the truth and we can see this happening now within the church.\nYou see God knows who belongs to him and he knows who don't, you can't fool God and if you think you can then you are fooling yourself.\nIf you have made Jesus your Lord and Savior but you love this life so much and all it has to offer that you would wipe your Christian brother or sisters name through the mud, I would be questioning if you have made a real commitment to the gospel message.\nWhen sin takes over a nation the people mourn but when the Church goes through hard times she will come out STRONGER.\nA church that has been through the FIRE, loves their brother's &amp; sister's, they have a deeper love for the LOST and an UNSHAKABLE faith in JESUS CHRIST\nPersecution is coming and it is coming faster than many of us may think, my question is are we ready?\nThe reality of this message is shocking, but when persecution comes and knocks on your door will you stand up for your faith in Christ or fold like a dusty old book that has been on a shelf for years.\nMy prayer is that each and every one of us will take a stand against the evil that floods our city's and towns and declare to this world the message of the gospel, the only hope we have, the hope that is found in Jesus Christ no matter the cost.\nThrough a close relationship with Jesus Christ we will be prepared for what the future holds! We must stay in fellowship with the true saints of God, know what His word says and diligently seek Him in our prayers, listening to His voice.\nI am not only saying these things for your benefit but also my own, so let's band together, love one another and live for the one who gave His all, not only at the cross but his entire life. Let's rise up and speaks words of hope and love to our enemy's and see this world changed.\nThis presentation is dedicated to an American pastor, Saeed Abedini who is currently in prison in Iran for his faith in Jesus Christ. Please keep Saeed and his family in your prayers and get involved in his case by going to the website at the end of this presentation.\nGod bless and thanks for watching\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVictoria, Nigeria - IDOP 2013:\nThis 5-minute IDOP video focuses on Victoria and Rejoice, two teenage girls who live in Gombe, Nigeria. One day as the girls worshiped at the Deeper Life Church, they came under attack from radical Muslims. Both girls lost family members.\n\nBelievers like Victoria and Rejoice need our prayers. To encourage more prayer for the persecuted, this year VOM is offering our 2013 IDOP video for free. Please share the DVD with your pastor, and ask him to share it with your church on Nov. 3, the International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church. Please also share it with your family, friends and Sunday school class. We want believers to know what is happening to our brothers and sisters in Nigeria so they can join us in prayer for them.\n\nGo to http://www.icommittopray.com to show your commitment to pray for the persecuted church and begin to receive weekly prayer updates when the full site launches on Nov. 3.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;TRUE LOVE&quot;:\nOne of the most powerful insperational video's you will ever see. For anyone confronted with the perposterous accusation of the Christian God being a shallow, uncaring and selfish god, then this video is for you!\n\nThis is a story of love that will leave you in a state of awe. If you have ever doubted you are loved this one is truly for you. A MUST SEE and a real TEAR JERKER.\nOpen up your heart and take a journey into the lives of a Father and a Son and see how they both change the world with a single choice.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSigns - Part 37:\nA compilation of various short clips presenting recent apocalyptic signs occurring around the world today and help us identify the state of affairs ushering the end of days.  View what's been happening in our time and descern for yourself the onset of Revelations and what may lay ahead.  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional videos included...\nThe Persecution of The Christians has already begun\nWalid Shoebat's New Initiative - Rescue Christians in Pakistan (1 &amp; 2)\n\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH.
