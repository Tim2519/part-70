When a jaguar attacks Abeguar and JanaÃƒÂ­na, he jumps off a cliff with her and he flies. The shaman advises Abeguar that he was the chosen one by the god MunhÃƒÂ£ to lead his tribe and fight against the evil AnhangÃƒÂ¡. When the tribe leader PiatÃƒÂ£ joins the French in the fight against the Portuguese, the entire TupinambÃƒÂ¡s are slaughtered and Abeguar turns into a bird that flies for more than two hundred years to find Janaina. In 1825, the warrior is Manuel Balaio that lives with JanaÃƒÂ­na and their two daughters in MaranhÃƒÂ£o. When one of his daughters is raped by the abusive police commander, Balaio leads the oppressed locals against the police and they take down the Caxias city. The government sends Duque de Caxias and his troops that vanquish the rebels and Balaio turns into a bird again that flies for more than one hundred and forty years to find JanaÃƒÂ­na again. In 1968, in Rio, the warrior is Cau, but JanaÃƒÂ­na is a revolutionary student that lives with another insurgent. When Cau and JanaÃƒÂ­na are arrested by the repressive police, Cau rats the insurgents to protect JanaÃƒÂ­na from the torture and he becomes an outcast by his former fellows. Only the jailer FeijÃƒÂ£o talks to him and Cau teaches him politics. With the amnesty, Cau moves to the slums with FeijÃƒÂ£o and becomes a teacher and member of the criminal group Falange Vermelha. When the police invade the slum, Cau turns into a bird again that flies for more than one hundred years to find JanaÃƒÂ­na again. In 2096, in Rio de Janeiro, very few people can afford water that is mostly used in the ethanol plantations by the governmental company AquabrÃƒÂ¡s. The warrior is now a journalist and JanaÃƒÂ­na a call-girl. When the president of AquabrÃƒÂ¡s is kidnapped by a group of insurgents, the warrior sees JanaÃƒÂ­na on television and heads to AquabrÃƒÂ¡s to save her.
