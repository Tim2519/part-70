It doesn't matter if we are performing live, recording separately in a studio, or even jamming along with a play-along song - we need to appreciate and understand how to play in relation to what other band members are doing. The most important relationship is with the bassist and what they are playing.\n\nIn this section you will be introduced to The Locked In SystemÃ¢â€žÂ¢. It includes three important phases to consider when 'locking-in' with a bassist. Reviewing these ideas will help you create a solid foundation to make the band sound and perform better as a team.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95f3c51ae45929175fb66b69b0a366b8094ac57d","amp;dn":"Jared+Falk+-+Successful+Drumming+%5BDVD+5%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95f3c51ae45929175fb66b69b0a366b8094ac57d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,243,197,26,228,89,41,23,95,182,107,105,176,163,102,184,9,74,197,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
