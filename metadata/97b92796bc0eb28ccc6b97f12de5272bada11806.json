Nobody could\n\nmiss the cello, or the fact that the reed player was as likely to be playing flute \n\nor clarinet as saxophone.  All 5 members of the original quintet were writers.\n\n\nThis upload gathers all known recordings of the quintet's gig at The Strollers\n\nin Long Beach, CA.  mostly from two Pacific Jazz LP's\n\n\nConsider this upload a tribute to recently deceased guitarist Jim Hall who\n\nlaunched his career with this collaboration.\n\n\nChico Hamilton's experience as an vocal accompanist gave him the ability to be \n\nexpressive at low volume.  His playing reminds me of Shelly Manne.\n\n\n\nCD#1:    1-5  from Pacific Jazz LP  PJ 1209\n\n         6-8  unreleased Live at The Strollers   1955\n\n\nCD#2:    1-3  unreleased Live at The Strollers   1955\n\n         4    from JWC-503\n\n         5-13 from World Pacific WP 1287         1955","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97b92796bc0eb28ccc6b97f12de5272bada11806","amp;dn":"orig+CHICO+HAMILTON+QUINTET%2FLive+at+Strollers%28complete%29%2F1955","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97b92796bc0eb28ccc6b97f12de5272bada11806","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,185,39,150,188,14,178,140,204,107,151,241,45,229,39,43,173,161,24,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
