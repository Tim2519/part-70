During the protest in support of the First Amendment and against the establishmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s corporate propaganda media and its distortion of the assassination, Dallas Sheriff's deputies assaulted demonstrators and imposed an iron-fisted censorship. \n\nOn today's broadcast, Alex covers the continuing arrogance of a tyrannical state as it sloughs off criticism of the NSA's Stasi-like unconstitutional surveillance. \n\nAlex also takes a look at the possibility of regional war in the Middle East in the wake of an agreement between Iran and Western nations in Geneva. Both Israel and Saudi Arabia have threatened war if an agreement on Iran's nuclear program was reached.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
