Unfortunately there's only one series consisting of six episodes but never fear, David has gone off on a tangent (as is his want) and made an enviable comedy career for himself all around the globe. He also won a Perrier Award... which is fancier than it sounds :p This download contains all 6 episodes PLUS &quot;My Beefs 2009-2012&quot;. You're welcome :)\n\nPlease probe my increasingly popular IMDb list:\nBEST BRITISH COMEDY SERIES': My Top 100 Pom-Coms    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/list/tk9Ev4e6mBY/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/list/tk9Ev4e6mBY/&lt;/a&gt;\n*I'm very proud of it because it's received over 100,000 views. If you know of any other user-compiled IMDb lists that are less than 18 months old and have over 100,000 views, let me know... because I'm under the impression that I've achieved something :D\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43bff13d8ccac2cf5e5f3b808ee07f4ed754548f","amp;dn":"The+Modest+Adventures+Of+David+O%27Doherty+%282007%29+%2B+My+Beefs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43bff13d8ccac2cf5e5f3b808ee07f4ed754548f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,191,241,61,140,202,194,207,94,95,59,128,142,224,127,78,215,84,84,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
