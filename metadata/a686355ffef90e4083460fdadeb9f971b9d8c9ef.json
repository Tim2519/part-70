Through the eyes of key people--Jacob Lew, White House director of the Office of Management and Budget; Douglas Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office; Blackstone founder and former Commerce Secretary Pete Peterson; and more--Wessel gives readers an inside look at the making of our unsustainable budget.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a686355ffef90e4083460fdadeb9f971b9d8c9ef","amp;dn":"David+Wessel+-+Red+Ink","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a686355ffef90e4083460fdadeb9f971b9d8c9ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,134,53,95,254,249,14,64,131,70,15,218,222,185,249,113,185,216,201,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
