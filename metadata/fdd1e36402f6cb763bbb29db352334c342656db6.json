Howard stories with cover art by definitive Conan illustrator Frank Frazetta. \n\n\nFrank Frazetta once said regarding illustrating Conan:\n&quot;I much prefer illustrating the tales of Robert E. Howard. They are much stronger in mood and narration than those of Burroughs and allow a wider range of illustrative interpretations. As St. John is remembered for Edgar Rice Burroughs and Tarzan, I would like to be remembered for REH and Conan. I feel a certain sense of loss that Howard isn't alive to appreciate what I've done with Conan.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdd1e36402f6cb763bbb29db352334c342656db6","amp;dn":"Robert+E.+Howard%27s+Conan+-+The+Frazetta+Cover+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdd1e36402f6cb763bbb29db352334c342656db6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,209,227,100,2,246,203,118,59,187,41,219,53,35,52,195,66,101,109,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
