Death holds no fear for him because Hercule feels dead. Haunted by a crime committed against his wife and children, he must atone by accepting even the most demented orders from his senior officers, the Axiomatikos. Exactly 12 missions for redemption.\n\nFirst, Eurystheus will send Hercule to the planet Nemea. On that tortured land a terrifying creature is attacking farms and decimating entire families. Hercule will have to hunt that vile beast, leaving behind the savagery and secrets that the Axiomatikos want to hide, at all costs, from the people they rule with an iron hand.\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a54276f81f1dbd9ec62691fc67066dce85777a97","amp;dn":"Hercule+%231+-+The+Blood+of+Nemea+%282012%29+%28GP-Alice%29cbz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a54276f81f1dbd9ec62691fc67066dce85777a97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,66,118,248,31,29,189,158,198,38,145,252,103,6,109,206,133,119,122,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
