ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a fantastic fable or the musings of an overzealous archaeologist. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s straight out of the pages of the Bible. The 120+ pictures displayed in On the Trail of the Nephilim have not been altered in any way. What you are about to see is truly a ground-breaking revelationÃ¢â‚¬â€an unparalleled discovery that may leave you in stunned silence. It left our own Gary Stearman almost speechless. But not before he said in an visibly excited voice, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Does L.A. realize what he has here? This has never been done before. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exposed the whole evolution cover-up for all to see. This is amazing!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThis book is the culmination of a lengthy search for the physical evidence of the Nephilim, the Giants of Old Testament lore. A significant cover-up has taken place over the years, reducing these double-digit, gigantic hybrids to the dustbins of history. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to read about the organizations behind this Darwinian-flavored scheme and why they hate the bones and skulls of the Nephilm so much. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll go to incredible lengths to make this evidence disappear! But make no mistake aboutÃ¢â‚¬â€the Nephilim were here. Hundreds of excavated graves scattered throughout the world provide evidence of their genetic abominationÃ¢â‚¬â€the product of the breeding of heavenly angels with the women of Earth during the days of Noah. These ancient builders left behind evidence of their supernatural strength and technological know-how. Their massive, megalithic structures are legendary and evidence of Nephilim architecture abounds worldwide.\n\nMarzulli and a team of scientists, archaeologists and scholars traveled to the jungles of a foreign land, perhaps the only place where they could gain access to the unspoiled evidence of this genetic manipulationÃ¢â‚¬â€PERUÃ¢â‚¬â€toppling perhaps the greatest cover-up in mankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bizarre history. Crawling through caves deep in the Peruvian jungle, accompanied by a private native guide, they discovered the remains of an ancient civilization, a shocking find that left the team in awe. As they held these strange, ancient skulls in their hands, the team knew that this was a story that must be be told. The world must know the truth about Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Days of Noah.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ See the skulls for yourself in On the Trail of the NephilimÃ¢â‚¬â€elongated, distorted skulls with massive eye sockets, bizarre jaw lines, and red hair! Simply put, these skulls are not human! DNA testing is pending!\n\nThe story doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t end with jungles, caves and ancient skulls. While in Peru, they had an epiphany. What if these Ã¢â‚¬Å“fallen angelsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were using their superior knowledge of technology to seek world domination, reducing mankind to mere slaves in their sordid scheme? Was it their desire to be worshipped as gods, like their leader, the fallen archangel Lucifer? Were these angels building a network of worldwide power centers in hopes of seeking complete control of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Creation? Was there a sophisticated power grid that provided an incredible source of energy? Did these fallen angels know and understand the secrets of heaven? Were they willingly worshipped by the people of Earth? Did they have some sort of device that enabled them to manipulate enormous 120 ton stones like they were marshmallows and shape them and move them to and fro like they were childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s building blocks? Did they leave evidence of this super device behind?\n\nL.A. Marzulli may have connected the dots in a story far bigger than the world could ever imagine. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the whole story of his teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trip to the land that time has forgottenÃ¢â‚¬â€PERU. This one-of-a-kind travelogue, complete wth shocking pictures of things you have NEVER SEEN BEFORE, straight from the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s camera, is accompanied by interviews from noted archaeologists Fritz Zimmerman, Aaron Judkins, and Watchers director, Richard Shaw, who accompanied L.A. on the trip. He has also included a doctorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s medical opinion about what they have discovered. The truth is now in your hands. The cover-up must end. This may be the most unusual book offered in the history of Prophecy in the News!
