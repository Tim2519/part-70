I've posted the lyrics because the Mormon Tabernacle Choir is not known for their diction)\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1597009d3681c72f6c963d27ee8e394360dcaa93","amp;dn":"Finlandia%3A+Ormandy+%26amp%3B+Phila+Orch+%26amp%3B+Mormon+Tabernacle+%5BFLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1597009d3681c72f6c963d27ee8e394360dcaa93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,151,0,157,54,129,199,47,108,150,61,39,238,142,57,67,96,220,170,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
