It acts as a proxy and will forward the traffic of your internet applications multiple encrypted to the mix cascades and so it will hide your ip address. It is a Java application, open source and you can download it for free. You may use JonDonym for free, but free mix cascades are restricted in some cases. Full speed and anonymisation features you will get only with a premium account.\n\nJonDo will provide an anonymisation proxy for you, but it does NOT change your system setting. You have to configure the proxy setting of each internet application you want to use anonymous with JonDonym by yourself. Tutorials you may find in the online help. \n\nJonDoFox is a profile for the Mozilla Firefox web browser particularly optimized for anonymous and secure web surfing. It is highly recommended for anonymous surfing together with JonDo and can be used for other anonymsation services too (like Tor Onion Router).\n\nJonDo v00.19.001\nJonDoFox v2.9.0\n\njondo_all.deb: Package for Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, ..\njondo_linux.tar.bz2: Archive for Linux, *BSD, ..\n\njondofox-en_all.deb: Package for Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, ..\njondofox_linux_mac_en-US.tar.bz2: Archive for Linux, *BSD, ..\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e2262ebaf0cd0b0a2cd35c4343befa9cbcfbeaf","amp;dn":"JonDo+%2B+JonDoFox+Private+and+Secure+Web+Surfing+for+Linux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e2262ebaf0cd0b0a2cd35c4343befa9cbcfbeaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,34,98,235,175,12,208,176,162,205,53,196,52,59,239,169,203,207,190,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
