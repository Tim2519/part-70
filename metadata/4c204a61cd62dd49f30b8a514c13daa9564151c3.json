MediaCoder won't validate the license I PAID for anymore and I received NO support from the official sources. I am convinced it is something on there end at this point. I have been fighting with them to give me some support since I released my last torrent. So encodes that take 23 minutes, take 2 hours 23 minutes because of a queue limit. Unless someone here creates a crack for me (If you do, all I need is the queue limit removed) I will be using Handbrake again from now on.\n\nAlso Robotech - Protoculture Collection [Remastered] is on indefinite hiatus because of this. It is 1/3 done in 10bit before MediaCoder just randomly died on me. Also I have gotten pretty good at Deinterlacing (pretty much perfect) but Handbrake does not have the same options MediaCoder does, so a step back in that department as well. I did find a similar setting in Handbrake and it does a decent job but it destroys my processing time.\n\nBefore someone asks, SUPER refuses to install on my Windows 8.1 machine, and MeGUI just takes to long to set up all the scripts, etc, etc. I don't have that kind of time anymore, need at least a semi automated process like MediaCoder. Unless there is another option similar to Handbrake or MediaCoder I don't know about that supports 10-bit.\n\nSource...\nUntouched VIDEO_TS\n\nOverall bit rate: 1,511 - 1,926 Kbps\n\nVideo...\nFormat profile: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;8ec6e7e9e6cec2baa0be&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nBit depth: 8 bits\nDisplay aspect ratio: 16:9\nResolution: 720x482\nBit Rate: 1,033 - 1,439 Kbps\n\nEnglish Audio...\nFormat: AC3\nBit rate: 224 Kbps\nChannels: Stereo\n\nJapanese Audio...\nFormat: AC3\nBit rate: 224 Kbps\nChannels: Stereo\n\nVobSub English Subtitles\n\nChapters in each episode ported over from DVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c204a61cd62dd49f30b8a514c13daa9564151c3","amp;dn":"Bleach+268-279+%5BHQ%5D%5BDual-Audio%5D%5BUncut%5D+Box+Set+19","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c204a61cd62dd49f30b8a514c13daa9564151c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,32,74,97,205,98,221,73,243,11,138,81,76,19,218,169,86,65,81,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
