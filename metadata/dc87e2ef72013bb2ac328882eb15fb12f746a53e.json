So when the well-heeled Branson family wants to memorialize their murdered son in a coffin portrait, Cherry scrambles to win their patronage from her small town rival.\n\nAs the clock ticks toward the deadline, Cherry faces more trouble than just a controversial subject. Between ex-boyfriends, her flaky family, an illegal gambling ring, and outwitting a killer on a spree, Cherry finds herself painted into a corner sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be lucky to survive.\n\nStill Life in Brunswick Stew (A Cherry Tucker Mystery #2) \n\nCherry TuckerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in a stew. Art commissions dried up after her nemesis became president of the County Arts Council. Desperate and broke, Cherry and her friend, Eloise, spend a sultry summer weekend hawking their art at the Sidewinder Annual Brunswick Stew Cook-Off. When a bad case of food poisoning breaks out and Eloise dies, the police brush off her death as accidental. However, Cherry suspects someone spiked the stew and killed her friend. As Cherry calls on cook-off competitors, bitter rivals, and crooked judges, the police get steamed while the killer prepares to cook CherryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s goose.\n\nHijack in Abstract (A Cherry Tucker Mystery #3) \n\nWith a classical series sold and a portrait commissioned, Cherry TuckerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s art career is in Georgia overdrive. But when the sheriff asks Cherry to draw a composite sketch of a hijacker, her life takes a hairpin as the composite leads to a related murder, her local card-sharking buddy Max Avtaikin becomes bear bait and her nemesis labels the classical series Ã¢â‚¬Å“pervert art.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nCherryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jamming gears between trailer parks, Atlanta mansions, and trucker bars searching for the hijacker who left a widow and orphan destitute. While she seeks to help the misfortunate and save her local reputation, CherryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hammer down attitude has her facing the headlights of an oncoming killer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc87e2ef72013bb2ac328882eb15fb12f746a53e","amp;dn":"A+Cherry+Tucker+Mystery+Series+-+Larissa+Reinhart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc87e2ef72013bb2ac328882eb15fb12f746a53e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,135,226,239,114,1,59,178,172,50,136,130,235,21,251,18,247,70,165,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
