You have to love it and wish it well and not preach or think you have any reason to think you are better than anyone else. Amen. Good-bye. Peace . . .\n\nMaster short story writer Ellen Gilchrist, winner of the National Book Award, returns with her first story collection in over eight years. In Acts of God, she has crafted ten different scenarios in which people dealing with forces beyond their control somehow manage to survive, persevere, and triumph, even if it is only a triumph of the will.\n\nFor Marie James, a teenager from Fayetteville, Arkansas, the future changes when she joins a group of friends in their effort to find survivors among the debris left when a tornado destroys a neighboring town.\n\nFor Philipa, a woman blessed with beauty and love and a life without care, the decision she makes to take control of her fate is perhaps the easiest she has ever made. As she writes to Charles, her husband and lifetime partner, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nothing is of value except to have lived well and to die without pain.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nFor Eli Naylor, left orphaned by a flood, there comes an understanding that sometimes out of tragedy can come the greatest good, as he finds a life and a future in a most unexpected place.\n\nIn one way or another, all of these people are fighters and believers, survivors who find the strength to go on when faced with the truth of their mortality, and they are given vivid life in these stories, told with Ellen GilchristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear-eyed optimism and salty sense of humor.\n\nAs a critic in the Washington Post wrote in reviewing one of the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earlier works, Ã¢â‚¬Å“To say that Ellen Gilchrist can write is to say that Placido Domingo can sing. All you have to do is listen.\n\n**\n\nFrom Booklist\n\nStarred Review Gilchrist will remain forever beloved for Victory over Japan (1984), her National Book AwardÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning collection of short stories. Many outstanding novels have been added to her oeuvre over the years, but GilchristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deliciously wise and humorous voice abides best in the short story form, and her new collection of 10 stories will say to her fans that their reconnection to this openhearted writer from the South is a pure old-home-week experience (especially given that recurring Gilchrist characters make welcome appearances). A thematic connection unifies the stories, which generally reflect recent national events and current social and political conditions that put individualsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ moxie to the test. For instance, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Toccata and Fugue in D Minor,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a beautiful, smart, phenomenally rich story, sees three middle-aged women, former college buddies, off to a vacation in Italy, but they are sidelined along the way by terrorist activity; in post-Katrina New Orleans in the title story, an elderly coupleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last effort at independence from caretakers and infirmities has fatal results, but after their deaths, their youngest son creates an elaborate family tree celebrating life over death. Gilchrist has no interest in soap-box preaching or, for that matter, in sentiment. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s character exploration she seeks, pure and simple. --Brad Hooper\n\nReview\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[GilchristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s] style can be an acquired taste. If I were you, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d acquire it . . . Gilchrist manages to cut through the loud tussle of the world to present truths made even more striking by how conventional they are . . . The stories in Acts of God are great postcards from the world of Ellen Gilchrist. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a world of war and strife and surprises, and it is, yes, marvelous to behold.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€The New York Times Book Review\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Admirers of her work, among whom I am most certainly to be counted, will find much herein that is familiar and pleasing . . . Gilchrist is at her best when the wry and satirical mood strikes her, especially when she is pricking the balloons of pride that the white Southern upper middle class inflates in its own honor. Now in her late 70s, she has lost none of the zing that brought In the Land of Dreamy Dreams to such wholly unexpected attention, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a pleasure to report that the best of the stories in Acts of God rank with the best in her first collection and in her second, Victory Over Japan, for which she was awarded a richly deserved National Book Award in 1984.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€*The Washington Post\n\n*Ã¢â‚¬Å“Flawlessly precise.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ReadersDigest.com\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A joy to read. Her protagonists all feel very alive and real.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€***Bust\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[GilchristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s] protagonists are generally beautiful and strong, sometimes shallow and often deeply flawed--but theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re always interesting, especially when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re tested . . . In Acts of God, though, they learn a lesson that GilchristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s characters often donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t: that even the rich and the powerful, the quick-witted and the good-looking are vulnerable to storms and disasters, to illness and aging and death . . . These 10 new stories remind the reader weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all vulnerable to chance, whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a hurricane or a love affair. And these characters, the old ones and the new, settle seamlessly into GilchristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seductive Southern world.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Houston Chronicle\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The stories are laced through with good humor and hints of the miraculous . . . There is something--a magic thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult to clarify, that may be corny in someone elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes--to GilchristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come around often . . . Gilchrist still has the power to turn a simple line into a profound insight on what itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like to be human. Aging and death are the twin ghouls running throughout Acts of God*, looming over the characters, and the result of looking into the void gives these stories wisdom and compassion, or to quote Gilchrist: Ã¢â‚¬ËœGlad to be alive in the only world there is, alive and eating and still breathing and not afraid really of anything that might happen next.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Flavorpill.com** \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The latest story collection by 79-year-old Southern writer Ellen Gilchrist focuses on people grappling with events beyond their control . . . Captivating.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€***Chicago TribuneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Printers Row\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“GilchristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deliciously wise and humorous voice abides best in the short story form, and her new collection of 10 stories will say to her fans that their reconnection to this openhearted writer from the South is a pure old-home-week experience . . .
