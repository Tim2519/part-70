We have benefited from the kind intention of His will; therefore, we eagerly extend it to others. &quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.&quot; Ephesians 2:8-9 (ESV)\n\n2 Power of Prayer:\nPrayer is an invitation for us to participate in the incredible things God is doing. Colossians 4:2 calls us to &quot;Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving.&quot; Colossians 4:2 (ESV) Communication defines our relationships, we are encouraged to continually be diligent in prayer.\n\n3 Power of Love:\nThe world will know us as Christ's disciples by our legitimate love for people and our dedication to assess the real need. We believe that lost people matter to God; therefore, they matter to us. It is through this authenticity that we share Christ's love for people. &quot;For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.&quot; Luke 19:10\n\n4 Power of The Gospel:\nGod is about seeking lost and broken people. The image and purpose of Jesus's ministry is to rescue those who are lost. He seeks to save because He loves the lost and desires a relationship with us. &quot;For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.&quot; Luke 19:10 (ESV)\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH.
