And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about the first time this year that the phrase Ã¢â‚¬Å“the House voted toÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just followed with Ã¢â‚¬Å“to repeal Obamacare.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The vote was 332 to 94. The lesson here is evidently that if everybody really hates a bill, you can get a lot of people to vote for it.\n\nJohn Boehner is finally taking on the outside rightwing think tanks that push the Republican Party into taking such extreme positions. The GOPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s problem is that outside groups have already turned the Republican Party itself into an outside group.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s day two since Megan Kelly declared both Santa and Jesus white. So far, she has stopped there, but weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re watching her for further developments. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Santa is just whiteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ thing highlights a history Megan Kelly has of sensationalizing matters of race. This was just the first time that it bled over into mythical characters. On that note, can somebody ask Megyn Kelly if Hobbits are white people or not? IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure a lot of her viewers will want to know before they watch the new movie. Kelly was the one at Fox News who was pushing their absurd coverage of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“New Black PanthersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the hardestÃ¢â‚¬â€and all of Fox News was pushing that story hard. They were doing the Ã¢â‚¬Å“full Benghazi.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In a recent interview, Kelly took umbrage at those who called her obsession with the story Ã¢â‚¬Å“racist.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ She said Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m just covering a story.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ No, MegynÃ¢â‚¬â€youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re creating a story. Big difference!\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has executed his own uncle for being a Ã¢â‚¬Å“traitor for all the ages.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Give dictators creditÃ¢â‚¬â€they really come up with the most memorable phrases, like Ã¢â‚¬Å“traitor for all the agesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or the Ã¢â‚¬Å“mother of all battles.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ something about totalitarianism must bring out the best of a societyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s colorful linguistics. Freedom is gone, but flowery prose blossoms.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being reported that the fake interpreter from the Mandela memorial has a history of being charged with crimes including rape, kidnapping, and murder. What exactly do you have to do to get turned down for that interpreter gig? He was never convicted because he was judged mentally unfit to stand trial. Well hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a suggested punishmentÃ¢â‚¬â€take him off the list of people who get to hang out with the President of the United States when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in town.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b93e3f73dc2b0facd09d143c6a1502b29a79a36","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+December+13+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b93e3f73dc2b0facd09d143c6a1502b29a79a36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,147,227,247,61,194,176,250,205,9,209,67,198,161,80,43,41,167,154,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
