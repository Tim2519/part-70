Bigger additions are left out.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Find the file &quot;baldur.ini&quot; in the main game directory and edit following entries to match your extraction path:\n\n\tHD0:=C:_cacheBGBaldur's Gate Trilogy - Total Happiness\n\tCD1:=C:_cacheBGBaldur's Gate Trilogy - Total Happinessdata\n\tCD2:=C:_cacheBGBaldur's Gate Trilogy - Total Happinessdata\n\tCD3:=C:_cacheBGBaldur's Gate Trilogy - Total Happinessdata\n\tCD4:=C:_cacheBGBaldur's Gate Trilogy - Total Happinessdata\n\tCD5:=C:_cacheBGBaldur's Gate Trilogy - Total Happinessdata\n\tCD6:=C:_cacheBGBaldur's Gate Trilogy - Total Happinessdata\n\n   Make sure the &quot;data&quot; at the end of the CDx lines is left there.\n\n2. Run &quot;setup-widescreen.exe&quot; and follow the on-screen instructions.\n\n3. Run &quot;setup-generalized_biffing.exe&quot; and follow the on-screen instructions.\n   I recommend to biff all files, so in-game stuttering is eliminated or reduced.\n\n4. (optional) Run &quot;BiG World Clean-Up.bat&quot; to save a about 2GB of drive space.\n\n5. Enjoy!\n\n\nNotes on the setup process:\n\n Big World Fixpack commited on 2013-12-01 was used.
