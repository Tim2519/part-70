Father Ben Harmon (Dylan McDermott) is trying to deal with his wife's rejection after he has an affair with a student, and soon falls under the house's sway. Meanwhile, wife Vivien (Connie Britton) must not only try to forgive her husband but deal with the aftereffects of a miscarriage. Daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga) is confronted with hostile girls at her new school and befriends her father's disturbed teenage patient, Tate Langdon (Evan Peters).
