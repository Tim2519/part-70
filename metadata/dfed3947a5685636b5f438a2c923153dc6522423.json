I'm currently listening to the cd and it's just wonderful. I've had the cd since the movie came out, and the longer I have it, the more I enjoy it. Although, I think the two rap songs kind of ruin the mood a little bit. My favorites include the first five tracks (I could just sit here and listen to Bush's &quot;In A Lonely Place&quot; until my batteries die), NY Loose's &quot;Spit', Korn's &quot;Sean Olson&quot;, and Iggy Pop's &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot;. All in all, this is a great cd and I'm glad I bought it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfed3947a5685636b5f438a2c923153dc6522423","amp;dn":"The+Crow+-+City+of+Angels+320cbr+1996+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfed3947a5685636b5f438a2c923153dc6522423","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,237,57,71,165,104,86,54,181,244,56,162,201,35,21,61,198,82,36,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
