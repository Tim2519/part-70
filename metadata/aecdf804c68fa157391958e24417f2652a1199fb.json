LourdsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ religious extremist captors need him to help find the document to achieve their evil ends.

He's had a rich and varied life, and is fascinated by history, human accomplishment, and archeology. He began the book The Atlantis Code after seeing an article in a scholarly journal. The piece featured a satellite photo, and pointed out ruins visible in Spain which matched closely the description of Atlantis relayed in the writings of Plato. Because the ruins were located in a famous national park, he was certain they would never be explored. That got him thinking about just what treasures are buried beneath the earth. The result was The Atlantis Code. The book is the author's first published adventure thriller.
