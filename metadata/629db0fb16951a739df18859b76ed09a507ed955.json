It's a story that could happen to you. It is a film about an ordinary man, who is forced to choose between life and death of his own child. THE TRAP is a film about post-Milosevic's Serbia, in which there is no more war, but there is moral and existential desert, about Serbia in transition, in which human life still doesn't worth a lot, about normal life which still seems unreachable.\n\n\nLanguage: Serbian\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:629db0fb16951a739df18859b76ed09a507ed955","amp;dn":"Klopka+aka+The+Trap+2007+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"629db0fb16951a739df18859b76ed09a507ed955","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,157,176,251,22,149,26,115,157,241,136,89,183,110,208,154,80,126,217,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
