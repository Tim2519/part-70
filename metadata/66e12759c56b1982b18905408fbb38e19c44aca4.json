Together with the already imprisoned Nelson Mandela, they were put on trial and charged with conspiring to overthrow the apartheid government by violent revolution. Their expected punishment was death. In this compelling book, their defence attorney, Joel Joffe, gives a blow-by-blow account of the most important trial in South AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history, vividly portraying the characters of those involved, and exposing the astonishing bigotry and rampant discrimination faced by the accused, as well as showing their incredible courage under fire.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66e12759c56b1982b18905408fbb38e19c44aca4","amp;dn":"The+State+vs.+Nelson+Mandela++%282013+-+PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66e12759c56b1982b18905408fbb38e19c44aca4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,225,39,89,197,107,25,130,177,137,5,64,143,187,56,225,156,68,172,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
