It reminds me of the Cult,\nespecially in the vocal department.\nIt's a shame they didn't have more opportunities to make more records.\n\n01. Metal Queen Hijack\n02. The Absolute Queen Of Pop \n03. City Of Angels\n04. Loving You Is A Dirty Job (But Somebody's Gotta Do It)\n05. Unnatural Woman \n06. The Bomb And The Gun\n07. Last Night A Drag Queen Saved Your Life\n08. U.K. Rock City\n09. Something To Live And Breathe By \n10. Vagabond Sister\n11. Hair Of The Dog (That Bit Me) \n12. Hold Back The Storm \n\nEnjoy!!\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d4eeecd3a40ecf31612e00f92c944aea4e48eca","amp;dn":"RPLA+-+RPLA+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d4eeecd3a40ecf31612e00f92c944aea4e48eca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,78,238,205,58,64,236,243,22,18,224,15,146,201,68,174,164,228,142,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
