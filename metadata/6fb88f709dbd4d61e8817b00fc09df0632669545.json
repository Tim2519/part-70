Thief's Covenant\n\nOnce she was Adrienne Satti. An orphan of Davillon, she had somehow escaped destitution and climbed to the ranks of the city's aristocracy in a rags-to-riches story straight from an ancient fairy tale. Until one horrid night, when a conspiracy of forces-human and other-stole it all away in a flurry of blood and murder. Today she is Widdershins, a thief making her way through Davillon's underbelly with a sharp blade, a sharper wit, and the mystical aid of Olgun, a foreign god with no other worshippers but Widdershins herself. It's not a great life, certainly nothing compared to the one she once had, but it's hers. But now, in the midst of Davillon's political turmoil, an array of hands are once again rising up against her, prepared to tear down all that she's built. The City Guard wants her in prison. Members of her own Guild want her dead. And something horrid, something dark, something ancient is reaching out for her, a past that refuses to let her go. Widdershins and Olgun are going to find answers, and justice, for what happened to her-but only if those who almost destroyed her in those years gone by don't finish the job first.\n\n2. False Covenant\n\nThe Church is finally lifting its interdictions and the city has begun to recover, but much of the populace-angry at the clergy-has turned away from the Church hierarchy, choosing private worship or small, independent shrines. And the new bishop, concerned for his new position and angry at the people of Davillon, plans to do something about it. Through a combination of trickery and real magic, the bishop fakes the appearance of a supernatural threat, stalking the nighttime streets-something just frightening and just unnatural enough that it should drive the people to turn back to the Church for protection. It's a hoax that might have worked, had it not provided cover for a true creature of the other world to infiltrate the seedier streets of Davillon, to intertwine its tendrils through the lower echelons of society. Davillon faces not only a new political upheaval if the truth comes out, but a true supernatural threat to its citizenry. The local representatives of the Church are paralyzed by infighting and their own complicity. The Guard are in over their heads.\n\n3. Lost Covenant\n\nThis third YA novel starring the young thief Widdershins combines the angst and vulnerability of any teenage girl with the high action of the best fantasy adventures.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been six months since Widdershins and her own Ã¢â‚¬Å“personal godÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Olgun fled the city of Davillon. During their travels, Widdershins unwittingly discovers that a noble house is preparing to move against the last surviving bastion of the Delacroix family.\n\nDetermined to help the distant relatives of her deceased adopted father, Alexandre Delacroix, she travels to a small town at the edge of the nation. There, she works at unraveling a plot involving this rival house and a local criminal organization, all while under intense suspicion from the very people sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trying to rescue.\n\nAlong the way sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to deal with a traitor inside the Delacroix family, a mad alchemist, and an infatuated young nobleman who wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take no for an answer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fb88f709dbd4d61e8817b00fc09df0632669545","amp;dn":"A+Widdershins+Adventure+-+Ari+Marmell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fb88f709dbd4d61e8817b00fc09df0632669545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,184,143,112,157,189,77,97,232,129,123,0,252,9,223,6,50,102,149,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
