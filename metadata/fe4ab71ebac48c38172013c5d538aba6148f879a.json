There also should be no cd-images mounted while booting, otherwise the UEFI-startup script will not work.\n\nI did briefly login to steam and look around, so there might be some unnecessary cache files on the disk, but otherwise it's a clean install.\n\n\nScreenshot: http://image.bayimg.com/5a3fc586040ea4e04eb6e5d4b4684aee60a3587a.jpg\n\n\nHave fun!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe4ab71ebac48c38172013c5d538aba6148f879a","amp;dn":"SteamOS+installed+%26amp%3B+configured+for+VirtualBox","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe4ab71ebac48c38172013c5d538aba6148f879a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,74,183,30,186,196,140,56,23,32,19,197,213,56,171,166,20,143,135,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
