It just so happens that his high school crush is Kaede Mizuno, a girl who adores cats. One day, while walking home from school, Junpei kicks an empty can and unfortunately beans the local neko-jiz?-sama (guardian deity of cats). Soon, he finds he can now understand what cats are saying, including his family's own ill-tempered cat, Nyamusasu. However, if he does not grant 100 wishes from cats, he will turn into a cat himself.\n\n\nfor updates:\ntwitter - @p7tricktorrent\nFacebook - /p7tricktorrent\n_________________________________________________________\n\nSEED!\n\nshare ratio:\n&quot;Scumbag = 0.1:1\nLeecher = 0.999:1\nMinimum = 1:1\nGood = 3:1\nGreat = 5:1\nAwesome = 10:1\n1337 = 100:1&quot;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc88b836417244ec85d3f47d4a42cd88006d5f74","amp;dn":"Nyan+Koi%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc88b836417244ec85d3f47d4a42cd88006d5f74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,136,184,54,65,114,68,236,133,211,244,125,74,66,205,136,0,109,95,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
