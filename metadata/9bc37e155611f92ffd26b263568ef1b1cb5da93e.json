Starting as a weekly in the mid-1920s, the magazine is now published 47 times per year, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. Although its reviews and events listings often focus on cultural life of New York City, The New Yorker has a wide audience outside of New York and USA. It is well known in its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric Americana; its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews; its rigorous fact checking and copyediting; its journalism on world politics and social issues; and its famous, single-panel cartoons sprinkled throughout each issue.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bc37e155611f92ffd26b263568ef1b1cb5da93e","amp;dn":"The_New_Yorker_December_16_2013.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bc37e155611f92ffd26b263568ef1b1cb5da93e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,195,126,21,86,17,249,47,253,38,178,99,86,142,241,177,203,93,169,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
