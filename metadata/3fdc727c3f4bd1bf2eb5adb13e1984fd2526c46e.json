It ended in March/April 2014.\n\nLearn about how psychology has developed a body of knowledge about behavior and mind through the use of scientific methods. All areas of psychology will be covered.\n\nSince we were young children, we have tried to understand, to predict, and to control behavior. We first dealt with our parents and teachers, and later our friends and companions. This course shows, however, how the understanding, prediction, and control of behavior require scientific validation. By using tools that are systematic and objective, psychology has learned how people behave and think.\n\nPsychology is a very broad field of study and the course will include discussions of the brain and nervous system, sensation and perception, learning, memory, intelligence and thinking, lifespan development, emotion and motivation, personality, social behavior, behavioral disorders, and psychological treatment of disorders. The course will include short lecture modules, demonstrations and experiments, and writing assignments. \n\nMore information about this course is available at https://coursera.org/course/psy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fdc727c3f4bd1bf2eb5adb13e1984fd2526c46e","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Introduction+to+Psychology+as+a+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fdc727c3f4bd1bf2eb5adb13e1984fd2526c46e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,220,114,124,63,75,209,191,46,181,173,177,62,25,132,253,37,38,196,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
