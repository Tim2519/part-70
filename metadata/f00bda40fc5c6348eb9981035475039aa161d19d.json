Based on a treasury of historical information that has been hidden from the public for nearly 70 years, the full stories of these 93 executed men are presented in this collection including their origins, their crimes, the investigations that brought them to justice, their trials, and their deaths at the gallows. This wealth of previously unpublished historical detail gives a vivid view of the sociology of early 20th-century crime and of the resulting prison life. Readers take a trip back in time to the hard-boiled early 20th-century California that inspired the novels of Dashiell Hammett and countless other crime writers. Illustrated throughout with authentic and haunting prison photographs of each of the condemned men, the crimes and punishments of a vanished era are brought into a sharp and realistic light.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f00bda40fc5c6348eb9981035475039aa161d19d","amp;dn":"Folsom+Prison%27s+Executed+Men++%282013+-+Retail+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f00bda40fc5c6348eb9981035475039aa161d19d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,11,218,64,252,92,99,72,235,153,129,3,84,117,3,154,161,97,209,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
