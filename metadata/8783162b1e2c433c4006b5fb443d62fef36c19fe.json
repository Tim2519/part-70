Infowars Nightly host David Knight and PrisonPlanet.com editor and writer Paul Joseph Watson file reports live from Copenhagen, Denmark. The Infowars team has been harassed and assaulted by Danish cops who are under orders to maintain tight security as the elite and their handpicked minions discuss the Ukraine crisis, the economic meltdown, the future of a sustainable middle class and other issues of import to the public but are debated and decided in private. \n\nAlex also covers the significance of a secretive meeting between Obama and his likely successor Hillary Clinton at the White House and other topics including the continued militarization of police.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
