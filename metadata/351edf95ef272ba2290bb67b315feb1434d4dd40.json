This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn 1974, all four members of the disbanded Beatles had solo hits in the top 40 at the same time. In this countdown there is a band that &quot;out-Beatles&quot; the Beatles by having four current or former members with solo hits, all while the band itself debuts with its current single.\n\nThe first extra is &quot;Modern Woman&quot; by Billy Joel (debuting this week at number 54) from the film &quot;Ruthless People.&quot; Also, El DeBarge is at number 18 with his hit, &quot;Who's Johnny&quot; from the film, &quot;Short Circuit.&quot; In order to provide a better 1986 experience, I am supporting the seeding for these two movies for at least a month AND to a ratio of 30 (whichever comes last), so you can download and run with a clear conscience. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be impatient though, I turned down the movie upload rates in favor of those who need their American Top 40 fix. \n\nIf you would like a copy of either of these, follow one of the links that appear after the countdown list.\n\nCasey tells the tale of the first country single ever to hit number one on the pop chart. It was an anti-smoking song released seventeen years before the anti-smoking bandwagon left ruts in mainstream public consciousness.\n\nThe Fabulous Thunderbirds are at number 24 with, &quot;Tuff Enuff.&quot; Casey tells how they had to replace their drummer in the middle of a tour, and ended up calling the Royal Canadian Mounted Police!\n\nFrom the AT40 Book of Records: Casey tells about the youngest performers (two infants each less than a year old ) ever to appear on a top 40 hit, and plays a small part of the song.\n\nHoward Jones is at number 14 with his song, &quot;No One Is To Blame.&quot; Casey tells who he was thinking of when he wrote it.\n\nOnly the second singer in chart history to have four top 10 hits from her debut solo album has that fourth song in this countdown.\n\nThat very last file (segment 99) is a notice that you can re-listen to the latest AT40 weekend broadcasts throughout the following week at the iHeart Radio link that follows. It looks like they are also playing shows from other years (and other times of the year) and they played the year-end countdown for 1986. If you can't get iHeart Radio in your country, there is a subscription service I use called DAR.FM (Digital Audio Recording). For $40 a year, it is not a bad deal. DAR records internet radio, and you play it back when you want, or you can download what you recorded. Everything is in 15 minute segments, and AT40 records at 96KBS, 44 kHz, joint stereo. I have included a sample.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iheart.com/live/Classic-American-Top-40-6545/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iheart.com/live/Classic-American-Top-40-6545/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n40: Out Of Mind, Out Of Sight - The Models\n39: Mothers Talk - Tears For Fears\n38: All The Things She Said - Simple Minds\n37: Invisible Touch - Genesis\n36: The Love Parade - Dream Academy\n35: When The Heart Rules The Mind - GTR\n34: Danger Zone (Theme From &quot;Top Gun&quot;) - Kenny Loggins\n33: Nasty - Janet Jackson\n32: Sledgehammer - Peter Gabriel\n31: Addicted To Love - Robert Palmer\nLDD: When The Going Gets Tough - Billy Ocean\n30: Like No Other Night - .38 Special\n29: Why Can't This Be Love - Van Halen\n28: Like A Rock - Bob Seger and The Silver Bullitt Band\n27: Your Wildest Dreams - Moody Blues\n26: Take Me Home - Phil Collins\n25: Your Love - The Outfield\n24: Tuff Enuff - Fabulous Thunderbirds\n23: Vienna Calling - Falco\n22: Rain On The Scarecrow - John Cougar Mellencamp\n21: Bad Bay - Miami Sound Machine\n20: West End Girls - Pet Shop Boys\n19: What Have You Done For Me Lately - Janet Jackson\n18: Who's Johnny - El DeBarge\n17: I Wanna Be A Cowboy - Boys Don't Cry\n16: Holding Back The Years - Simply Red\nLDD: Never Surrender - Corey Hart\n15: Nothin' At All - Heart\n14: No One Is To Blame - Howard Jones\n13: Is It Love - Mr. Mister\n12: Move Away - Culture Club\n11: Be Good To Yourself - Journey\n10: A Different Corner - George Michael\n9: There'll Be Sad Songs - Billy Ocean\n8: Crush On You - The Jets\n7: Something About You - Level 42\n6: If You Leave - Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark\nLDD: You're The Inspiration - Chicago\n5: All I Need Is A Miracle - Mike &amp; The Mechanics\n4: I Can't Wait - Nu Shooz\n3: Greatest Love Of All - Whitney Houston\n2: On My Own - Patti LaBelle and Michael McDonald\n1: Live To Tell - Madonna\n\nLinks to, &quot;Ruthless People&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6462232/_Ruthless.People.1986.DVDRip.H264.AAC.Gopo#filelistContainer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6462232/_Ruthless.People.1986.DVDRip.H264.AAC.Gopo#filelistContainer&lt;/a&gt;\n\nor\n\n\n\nLinks to, &quot;Short Circuit&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8009522/Short_Circuit_%281986%29_1080p_BrRip_x264_-_YIFY#filelistContainer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8009522/Short_Circuit_%281986%29_1080p_BrRip_x264_-_YIFY#filelistContainer&lt;/a&gt;\n\nor\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:351edf95ef272ba2290bb67b315feb1434d4dd40","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1986_June_7th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"351edf95ef272ba2290bb67b315feb1434d4dd40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,30,223,149,239,39,43,162,41,11,182,123,49,95,235,20,52,212,221,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
