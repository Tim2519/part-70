Charlie was a helper dog and he was good at getting his feeders safely around.  Now he and his pals Rover and Red must escape the failing New York City and find their way in this new order.  Ennis applies his incredible talent for creating rich and complex characters to a whole new species, with this shockingly original tale that is fully painted by Michael Dipascale.\n\n-------\n\nI really should be studying for my exams, but I'd been eagerly awaiting this comic so I took a break; and seeing as there is no torrent for it on TPB I decided to upload it as well. I very much enjoyed this comic, and if you like comics about animals (e.g. We3 and Pride of Baghdad) I think you'd enjoy this too. Definitely give it a shot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd39436b650ee754bbad170fa87d10376f5f2633","amp;dn":"ROVER+RED+CHARLIE+%231+by+GARTH+ENNIS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd39436b650ee754bbad170fa87d10376f5f2633","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,57,67,107,101,14,231,84,187,173,23,15,168,125,16,55,111,95,38,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
