Inspired to provide his growing family with meals as full of flavor as those he'd enjoyed at his mother's table, Michel planted a garden of his own. The result was a delicious array of recipes based on the best the garden or, if you're not that fortunate, the organic produce in the farmers' market or grocery store has to offer. Sweet tomatoes and bitter lettuces, peppery radishes and succulent strawberries these are but a handful of fruits, herbs, and vegetables that, served alone or combined with quality meats and poultry, ripened cheeses, or whole grains, inspired these 80 seasonal recipes, each one as good for the body as it is for the palate. Including a superb chapter on extending the harvest, full of fruit preserves and jams, pickled vegetables, sauces, salsas, flavored oils, spice mixes, and even a few refreshing drinks, Homegrown Pure and Simple is a book that not only conveys the sheer joy of feeding family and friends well, but also takes healthy cooking to an exciting and delicious new level.\n\n============================\n\nRachel's Everyday Kitchen: Simple, Delicious Family Food\n\nPublisher: HarperCollins Publishers Ltd\n2013\nRachel Allen\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0007462379\nISBN-13: 978-0007462377\nEPUB \n272 pages \n48 MB\n\nCookery teacher and home cook Rachel Allen returns with clever ideas, simple shortcuts and plenty of practical advice for achieving simple, wholesome and nutritious meals day after day. Rachel's Kitchen ties in to 13-part primetime television. This stunning, fully photographed cookbook includes over 100 tried-and-tested new recipes from bestselling cook Rachel Allen. After years of cooking for her family, teaching at the world-renowned Ballymaloe Cookery School and listening to the questions of home cooks, Rachel has pulled together an ultimate cookery manual for getting great food on the table throughout the week without stress, expensive bills or hours at the stove. Rachel's Kitchen is all about everyday clever cooking: simple shortcuts, advice on weekly planning and shopping, wasting less, freezing more, preparing ahead and using leftovers, recipes than can serve more and those that can be adjusted to a tasty meal for one or two. Rachel will show you how to cook once but achieve two or three meals. A side dish of baked broccoli with garlic and pine nuts can be transformed into a spelt salad with feta. Extra mashed potato and smoked fish from a fish pie can become instant, warming Cullen Skink the next day. Her approach saves time and money, but also allows cooking to be satisfying and enjoyable rather than a chore. Rachel's thrifty recipes don't require unusual ingredients that will linger at the back of the cupboard but affordable favourite ingredients that get used multiple times and underused cuts of meat or seasonal vegetables that can be made into a truly delicious dish. From fast family suppers, packed lunches and prepared-ahead meals to stress-free roasts and biscuit-tin sweet and savoury baking - Rachel's Kitchen is a must have, practical family cooking bible.\n\n============\n\nMiss Kay's Duck Commander Kitchen: Faith, Family, and Food--Bringing Our Home to Your Table\n\nPublisher: Howard Books\n2013\nKay Robertson\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1476745129\nISBN-13: 978-1476745121\nEPUB \n256 pages \n7.65 MB\n\nWriting a cookbook for people who love good food has been a lifelong dream for meÃ¢â‚¬â€and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m so happy to be sharing some of our familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite recipes with you!
