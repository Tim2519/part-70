Quite a few courageous jazzmen made jazz without \n\na piano; Gerry Mulligan comes to mind.  Far fewer formed a jazz TRIO without a \n\na piano and at least one of them did this without drums:  Jimmy Giuffre\n\n\nCD #1 contains studio recordings and CD #2 contains recordings made for TV\n\nand the Newport jazz festival.  Although 4 of the titles are repeated on both\n\nCD's the music is nearly 50% improvised so each take is going to be singular.\n\n\n\nConsider this another tribute to JIM HALL who expired last week.....One of my\n\nfavorites....\n\n\n\n\nR.I.P. JIM and thanks for enriching music culture with your recordings and\n\n       talent.  I wish I could have heard you perform &quot;live.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b092a9c1258817eee6cec2bde0f113f1a61528c0","amp;dn":"JIMMY+GIUFFRE+3+%2F+%281956-58%29+%2F+Jim+Hall+%2F+Atlantic+1254+%2F+2CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b092a9c1258817eee6cec2bde0f113f1a61528c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,146,169,193,37,136,23,238,230,206,194,189,224,241,19,241,166,21,40,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
