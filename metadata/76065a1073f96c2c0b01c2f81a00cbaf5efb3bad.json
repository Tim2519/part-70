Sidi's music comes from Gao, a city in the north of Mali, and draws inspiration from traditional music and religion, but is informed by western blues, rock, and culture. The winner of two Malian national awards for best singer, Sidi was leader of Gao's regional orchestra, The Songhai Stars, and is a nationally renowned figure in his home country.\n\nAccompanied by a guitarist, calabash player, traditional violin (sokou) player, and singer, Sidi has given us ten new songs that naturally mix tradition and modernity, African magic and city-dwelling dilemmas. The songs are personal tributes to the Songhai folk music traditions, which, depending on the rhythm, are called Takambas, Holleys, Gao-Gaos, or Shallos.\n\nThe album title Koima literally means 'go hear.' Koima is an emblematic place of Gao, 'a Dune with his feet in the waters of the river Niger, and with his head touching the sky,' says Sidi. In Malian folklore, Koima is the meeting place for the most powerful wizards of the world. Sidi received permission from the dune's chief to go on the dune and to swim in the Niger. This album is an offering to the mystical power of that place. (thrilljockey.com)\n\n- - -\n\nSidi Toure - Koima\n(Thrill Jockey Records 2012)\n\n 1. Ni See Ay Ga Done (It is To You That I Sing)\n 2.
