Smith is the author of six psychological thrillers and five books of nonfiction. The Great Boom Ahead, his collaboration with economist Henry Dent, was an international bestseller.\n\nCustomer Reviews\n\nIt's a keeper\nBy TheCafeWriter VINE VOICE on March 8, 2003\nFormat: Hardcover\nOkay, it wasn't at first. I found it a little overly-glib at times and the first section a little on the vague side as it explores brainstorming methods.\nBut delve deeper.\nFor example, when I got to his ten-card/10-scene framework, I tried applying it to a story I've been hopelessly stuck in for several weeks. The more I had tried to fix it, the more convoluted and confusing it became. But his method WORKED! In just one try, I found my story focus again and realized I'd been in serious danger of over-writing. Now I'm much closer to finishing it!\nIt's definitely not a book that's cover-to-cover, page-by-page reading, and it's not always easy to find the &quot;concepts.&quot; But it's really more a whole bunch of nuggets, some of which you'll find useful and some of which you may not.\nBut they're worth a try! Definitely a keeper.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccedcb7bc8566e7efcd563b3132dd736994b17ee","amp;dn":"Fiction+Writer%27s+Brainstormer+-+James+V.+Smith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccedcb7bc8566e7efcd563b3132dd736994b17ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,237,203,123,200,86,110,126,252,213,99,179,19,45,215,54,153,75,23,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
