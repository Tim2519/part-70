I got them from various sources that I don't recall.  \n\nThe video was shot as reference material for Richard Kaufmann to use for the BRO. JOHN HAMMAN book.  The quality is extremely poor.  It looks as if it was shot in Hamman's room in a retirement suite.  But the material is here.  Bro. John is struggling with his memory at some points and continually goes to his notes, but still provides magic that will outlive us all.  So, look at the material presented, not the quality of the video. \n\nIf someone has better copies, or the other videos, I would like to see the rest of the set posted.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:912ed5fe6656ac1097f80633e38e06a33d6bc8b7","amp;dn":"%28Magician%29+Brother+John+Hamman+-+The+Lost+Works+1%2C+3+%26amp%3B+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"912ed5fe6656ac1097f80633e38e06a33d6bc8b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,46,213,254,102,86,172,16,151,248,6,51,227,142,6,163,61,107,200,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
