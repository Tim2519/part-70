ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the folkily strummed acoustic, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the chiming and reverberating electric, and then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the lead, at once dramatic and intricate, carrying just a bit of fuzz.\n\nBut once Ã¢â‚¬Å“Things Will ChangeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ fully kicks in, with Reid MorrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plaintive and nostalgic lead vocals and a rhythm section that grooves deeply, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear that the Treetop Flyers offer much more than by-the-numbers Americana.\n\nThe Mountain Moves recalls the California rock of BuckinghamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fleetwood Mac and Little Feat more than the airier singer/songwriter stuff, but Treetop Flyers pack in the harmonies as well. First impressions of the album carry signposts of that vintage sound, but digging in on repeated listens, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a grittier force at work. Recorded at Zuma Sound in Malibu, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no doubt this is a California album, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music more for the avenues than the beach, palm trees lit by streetlights rather than a Pacific sunset.\n\nFormed in 2009 in West London when Morrison (Morrison Steam Fayre) and American drummer Tomer Danan (Robbers On High Street) recruited like-minded musicians Sam Beer (guitar/vocals), Laurie Sherman (guitar), Matthew Starritt (bass/vocals), the band took its name from the Stephen Stills song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Treetop Flyer.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Things Will ChangeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ works as a driving introduction to the band and transportation straight to the 1970s, framing a wistful set of lyrics about taking bad times in stride while making the most of the good times.\n\nFrom there, the band is off and running. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Houses Are BurningÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ blends vocal harmonies with an edgy groove, darkness and lightness holding each other at bay, the tension a vibrant force throughout the song. Musically, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Waiting On YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ takes the mood to a more laid-back zone, but as a tribute to MorrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s late father, the song packs a complex emotional punch, intertwining tears with smiles.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“RoseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mellowest moment, a swaying country tune of simple beauty. With its jittery guitar and insistent beat, Ã¢â‚¬Å“SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gonna RunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sounds like the soundtrack to some long-lost detective show. Ã¢â‚¬Å“PostcardsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ drags a doo-wop beat through Laurel Canyon, with a Ã¢â‚¬Å“shoop shoopÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ chorus guiding the homesick tale of a lonely traveler.\n\nIn the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final stretch, the six-minute Ã¢â‚¬Å“Storm Will PassÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ begins like a weary late afternoon before building and building in intensity, while the finger-picked acoustic guitar and pristine harmony on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Is It Worth ItÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ brings things to close with a campfire intimacy.\n\nProducer Noah Georgeson and the Treetop Flyers have crafted a remarkably balanced album that takes familiarity past the zone of simple comfort music. The album is a thrill, delivering unexpected updates on its vintage influences. More soul than folk and more rock than country, The Mountain Moves is an idyllic debut from a band that has traced its own lively arc through the So-Cal Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:802fcf783894639475c7f9b43c4612952f0c16c8","amp;dn":"Treetop+Flyers+-+The+Mountain+Moves+%5B2013%5D%5BWEB%3AFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"802fcf783894639475c7f9b43c4612952f0c16c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,47,207,120,56,148,99,148,117,199,249,180,60,70,18,149,47,12,22,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
