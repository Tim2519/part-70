Ralph McQuarrie, the legendary main concept artist for all three Star Wars films, and Kevin J. Anderson, the New York Times bestselling Star Wars author, present the ultimate voyage: a vivid and close-up look at the exotic worlds and remarkable inhabitants of the Star Wars universe.\n\nThe breathtaking artwork of McQuarrie and Anderson's delightful text are your guide to eight different Star Wars locales. Here, detailed as never before, are the worlds of Tatooine, the stark desert home planet of Luke Skywalker; Coruscant, the glorious center of the Empire; Dagobah, the swampy world of Yoda; Bespin, site of the famed floating metropolis of Cloud City; Endor, the forest moon sheltering the Ewoks; Hoth, the frozen wasteland and site of a secret Rebel base; Yavin 4, the jungle moon, nearly destroyed by the first Death Star; and Alderaan, Princess Leia's homeworld, cruelly annihilated by the same Death Star. Each world is lavishly illustrated and described by a qualified expert, including scientists, scouts, soldiers, poets, and even Imperial agents. The Illustrated Star Wars Universe is an epic achievement, a visionary treat no Star Wars fan will want to miss--and a true collector's item you'll enjoy for years to come.\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - The Art of Star Wars Episode V:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9316325&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9316325&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Music)] - Lazerhawk - Visitors (2012) [320 kbps]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9155397&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9155397&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n** If you have any questions please feel free to ask! **","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab751fa34104f28f2315e55cbae45096b9724a0b","amp;dn":"The+Illustrated+Star+Wars+Universe+%5B1995%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab751fa34104f28f2315e55cbae45096b9724a0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,117,31,163,65,4,242,143,35,21,229,92,186,228,80,150,185,114,74,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
