Another very disturbed series thanks to Garth Ennis and Jacen Burrows.\n\nTold in the style of the 'Night of the Living Dead' classics, the story follows a group of 'survivors' trying to make their way from one safe haven to another and just survive as an unexplained disease (or supernatural event) turns most of the world's population into inhibition-less cannibalistic killing and raping machines.\n\nThis is flat out gut-wrenching, disgusting fare. Then again, as it comes from Garth Ennis, if you are one who fancies yourself to be on a similarly misanthropic wavelength, you may find some humor in it as well, you sick puppy.\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - The Massive (#00-15) (Brian Wood) [Ongoing]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8931173&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8931173&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Music)] - State of Decay OST (2013) - Jesper Kyd:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n** If you have any questions please feel free to ask! **","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad77f1419cf939ef8495e1f2d3cc890fc979c28a","amp;dn":"Crossed+%28%23001-135%29+w%2FSpecials+%7C+%28Garth+Ennis%29+%5BOngoing%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad77f1419cf939ef8495e1f2d3cc890fc979c28a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,119,241,65,156,249,57,239,132,149,225,242,211,204,137,15,201,121,194,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
