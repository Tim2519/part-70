Investigating everything from the health benefits of chocolate and oxygenated water to the causes of food poisoning and the healing power of prayer, short commentaries use wit and humor to debunk folklore and misconceptions. Indicating which food studies can be trusted, this guide provides the knowledge needed to buy, store, and cook food without risking life and limb.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd009060aacbd2ff83ee8b95a88cdf64fbc736bd","amp;dn":"Let+Them+Eat+Flax++-+70+All-New+Commentaries+on+the+Science+of+E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd009060aacbd2ff83ee8b95a88cdf64fbc736bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,0,144,96,170,203,210,255,131,238,139,149,168,140,223,100,251,199,54,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
