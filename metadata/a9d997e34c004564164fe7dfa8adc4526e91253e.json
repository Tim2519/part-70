Look for approaching storms.\n\nSevere Storm Warning Tip #2:\nIf you see approaching storms or any of the danger signs, be prepared to take shelter immediately.\n\nSevere Storm Warning Tip #3:\nThey may strike quickly, with little or no warning.\n\nSituated just outside of Oklahoma City, Calumet County is divided into two drastically different communities: HopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Grove and Summit Bluffs. One is the small backward town where dirt roads lead the way to field parties and railroad tracks. And the other, a sprawling suburb where paved drives lead to the landscaped lawns of the wealthy and over privileged.\n\nFor five teenagers smack in the middle of Tornado Alley, summer is heating up fast. The winds of change are blurring the invisible line that divides the rich and the rural.\n\nOne has a secret.\nOne has a crush.\nOne has been lying.\nOne will get caught.\nAnd one might not make it out alive.\n\nTheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re from two different worldsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but one summer is about to change everything.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9d997e34c004564164fe7dfa8adc4526e91253e","amp;dn":"Storm+Warning+%5BBroken+Heartland%2C+%231%5D+-+E.+Lee+and+C.+Quinn.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9d997e34c004564164fe7dfa8adc4526e91253e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,217,151,227,76,0,69,100,22,79,231,223,168,173,196,82,110,145,37,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
