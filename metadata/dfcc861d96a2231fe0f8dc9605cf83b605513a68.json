The wife of a celebrated novelist, Alys moved in rarefied circles, and when Frances agrees to meet the bereaved family, she glimpses a world entirely foreign to her: cultured, wealthy, and privileged. While slowly forging a friendship with AlysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s carelessly charismatic daughter, Frances finds her own life takes a dramatic turn, propelling her from an anonymous existence as an assistant editor for the books section of a newspaper to the dizzying heights of literary society.\n\nTransfixing, insightful, and unsettling, Alys, Always drops us into the mind of an enigmatic young woman whose perspective on a glamorous world also shines a light on those on the outside who would risk all to become part of it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfcc861d96a2231fe0f8dc9605cf83b605513a68","amp;dn":"Alys%2C+Always+-+Harriet+Lane.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfcc861d96a2231fe0f8dc9605cf83b605513a68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,204,134,29,150,162,35,31,224,248,220,150,5,207,131,182,5,81,58,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
