At number 17 this week here's the J. Geils Band; their song, 'Freeze-Frame'.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\n&quot;Tainted Love&quot; by Soft Cell entered the hot 100 in January of 1982. It climbed to number 64 and then fell to number 100. Now, nineteen weeks later it is in the top 40 at number 39.\n\nCasey issues a correction. A few weeks prior he said that the largest number ever quoted in a chart song title was in Dickey Lee's &quot;9,999,999 Tears.&quot; But several listeners wrote in that a man named Alice holds the title-winning title. Casey gives the details.\n\nA listener wants to know if any married couples have ever hit the top 40. Casey says it has happened plenty of times, and then lists the nine couples that have hit number one.\n\nThis is the second week for Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts's second hit, &quot;Crimson &amp; Clover&quot; (at number 21). Casey tells how hard she worked to put it there. \n\nAnother listener writes in to ask if any top 40 hits have included real animal noises. Casey plays parts of songs that include sounds from real life crickets, dogs, birds, and a coyote, a horse, &amp; a lion.\n\nLW#3: Don't Talk To Strangers - Rick Springfield\nLW#2: Chariots Of Fire - Vangelis\nLW#1: Ebony And Ivory - Paul McCartney &amp; Stevie Wonder\n40:    I Don't Know Where To Start - Eddie Rabbitt\n39:    Tainted Love - Soft Cell\n38:    Circles - Atlantic Starr        \n37:    Hurts So Good - John Cougar     \n36:    Goin' Down - Greg Guidry     \n35:    Caught Up In You - .38 Special    \n34:    When It's Over - Loverboy\n33:    When He Shines - Sheena Easton\n32:    Love's Been A Little Bit Hard On Me - Juice Newton\n31:    Shanghai Breeze - John Denver\n30:    Without You - Franke &amp; The Knockouts\n29:    Wake Up Little Susie - Simon &amp; Garfunkel    \nLDD: Make A Move On Me - Olivia Newton-John\n28:    Let It Whip - The Dazz Band\n27:    My Girl - Donnie Iris\n26:    We Got The Beat - The Go-Go's\n25:    Body Language - Queen\n24:    Fantasy - Aldo Nova\n23:    Still In Saigon - The Charlie Daniels Band\n22:    Making Love - Roberta Flack\n21:    Crimson &amp; Clover - Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts\n20:    Rosanna - Toto\n19:    Run For The Roses - Dan Fogelberg\n18:    It's Gonna Take A Miracle - Deniece Williams\n17:    Freeze-Frame - J.
