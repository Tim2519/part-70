However, Don's father has checked-up on Joan's past, and finds out about her relationship with Eddie. When Don dumps her, she decides to run away from town, rather than returning to Eddie. In Montreal, she changes her name and resumes performing. Later, one of Eddie's men recognizes her, and informs his boss. Aware she cannot stay in Montreal forever, Joan trades places with her hotel's maid (Leila Bennett), who had used her picture when corresponding with a struggling North Dakota farmer in the height of the Great Depression. Offering the bride a large sum of money in exchange for the farmer's address, Joan becomes a mail-order bride to the farmer, Jim Gilson (George Brent).\n\nTheir relationship has a rocky start, when at the first night, a put off Joan rejects Jim's attempts to make love with her and suggests that they sleep apart. The next morning, she tries to apologize for her behavior, but Jim is not interested. Joan, who over the while falls in love with him, tries to win his affections, although Jim remains unmoved. Meanwhile, he is informed that he will lose his land if he does not make profit anytime soon. Even though he is certain that he has developed great wheat seed that can save him from a downfall, he has to convince fellow farmer Bull McDowell (David Landau), who has offered to buy his land in exchange for Joan's company. Despite never having showed affection for Joan, he is unhappy with another man thriving her attention, and starts a fight with him.\n\nSometime later, Joan drives out to an old woman who is giving birth. By this time, Joan has already broken with her city-girl image and slowly progressed into a farmer's wife. She helps the old woman and her adolescent daughter Sarah (Anne Shirley), and then races through a snow storm to return to her husband. There, she is informed by Jim that he has taken in a man who was injured during the storm. She finds out that the man is no other than Eddie. She initially pretends not to know him, but Eddie quickly tries to take her with him. \n\nRealizing his wife's past is a big lie, Jim concludes that she is worthless and suggests she go with Eddie. Joan refuses to leave him and even asks Eddie for a loan to save Jim's land.\n\nThrough the loan, Jim is allowed to pay of his debts until after the harvest. Joan continues to stand at his side, but Jim is unable to forgive her. Meanwhile, Bull has set the farm on fire, and Joan and Jim finally reconcile after Joan sustains injuries due to the fire. Together, they put out the fire, after which Jim admits he does love her.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 1:07:00\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 1:07:00","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b72dd32d59077728fe404a198ca3733ad70972cb","amp;dn":"Forbidden+Holywood+Collection+Vol.+3+-+Disk+1+-+Xvid+1cd+-+The+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b72dd32d59077728fe404a198ca3733ad70972cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,45,211,45,89,7,119,40,254,64,74,25,140,163,115,58,215,9,114,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
