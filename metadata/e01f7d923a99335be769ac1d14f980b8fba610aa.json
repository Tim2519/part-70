I wonder how many cats have died because of this confusion.&quot;\n\nFact: The most germ-laden place on your toilet isn't the seat or even the bowl--it's the handle.&quot;The solution: Don't flush. Let the next guy worry about it.&quot;\n\nThere are &quot;just the facts&quot;--and then there are just the facts that will frighten the bejeezus out of you. And thanks to this little gem of a bathroom book, you'll never look at the world the same way again, without, er, dry heaving a little bit.\n\nFrom the sneaky fish that can swim up our genitals to the &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria lurking in the very water we drink, disturbing phenomena are everywhere we turn. Educational, entertaining, and undeniably horrifying, this book isn't guaranteed to help you, um, go to the bathroom, but it's certain to make your time there more...informed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e01f7d923a99335be769ac1d14f980b8fba610aa","amp;dn":"1%2C001+Facts+that+Will+Scare+the+Shit+Out+-+Cary+Mcneal.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e01f7d923a99335be769ac1d14f980b8fba610aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,31,125,146,58,153,51,91,231,105,172,29,20,249,128,184,251,166,16,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
