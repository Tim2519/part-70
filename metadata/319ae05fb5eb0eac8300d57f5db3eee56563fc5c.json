Vector describe a shape mathematically; pixel images, on the other hand, describe the same shape in terms of a map of pixels. The key difference is that, as you increase the size of a pixel-based image, it begins to look blocky. Because vector images are based on mathematical formulas, they look good at any size and can be manipulated without losing resolution. When you create vector objects in a program like Photoshop, they are comprised of paths, which are in turn made up of anchor points and straight and curved segments, or lines. You can create these points and lines by working with the preset shapes or by creating your own shape.\n\nHow to Install Shapes?\n\nQuote:\n1.
