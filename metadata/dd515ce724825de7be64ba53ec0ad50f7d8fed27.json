Magic! Treasure! A gargoyle? Caroline Carlson's hilarious tween novel The Very Nearly Honorable League of Pirates #1: Magic Marks the Spot is perfect for fans of Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events and Trenton Lee Stewart's Mysterious Benedict Society.\n\nHilary Westfield has always dreamed of being a pirate. She can tread water for thirty-seven minutes. She can tie a knot faster than a fleet of sailors, and she already owns a rather pointy sword.\n\nThere's only one problem: The Very Nearly Honorable League of Pirates refuses to let any girl join their ranks of scourges and scallywags.\n\nBut Hilary is not the kind of girl to take no for answer. To escape a life of petticoats and politeness at her stuffy finishing school, Hilary sets out in search of her own seaworthy adventure, where she gets swept up in a madcap quest involving a map without an X, a magical treasure that likely doesn't exist, a talking gargoyle, a crew of misfit scallywags, and the most treacherousÃ¢â‚¬â€and unexpectedÃ¢â‚¬â€villain on the High Seas.\n\nWritten with uproarious wit and an inviting storyteller tone, the first book in Caroline Carlson's quirky seafaring series is a piratical tale like no other.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd515ce724825de7be64ba53ec0ad50f7d8fed27","amp;dn":"Magic+Marks+the+Spot+-+Caroline+Carlson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd515ce724825de7be64ba53ec0ad50f7d8fed27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,81,92,231,36,130,93,231,190,100,186,83,236,10,213,15,125,143,237,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
