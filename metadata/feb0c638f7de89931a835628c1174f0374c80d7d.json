It was released on 4 July 2007 in Japan and 9 July 2007 in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe song was written by Alex Turner and Johanna Bennett, Turner's girlfriend at the time, in a hotel room prior to the recording of Favourite Worst Nightmare. The song is a ballad about getting older and finding out that life isn't as fun anymore. It describes a woman who dreams of her youth while her current life is unsatisfying and boring, with emphasis on her sex life- this is reflected in the opening line, &quot;You used to get it in your fishnets, now you only get it in your nightdress, discarded all the naughty nights for niceness, landed in a very common crisis&quot;. &quot;Fluorescent Adolescent&quot; is one of the band's most popular songs, and is frequently performed as a closer to their concerts.\n\nFilmed in late April 2007, the music video was directed by Richard Ayoade (The IT Crowd/Nathan Barley) and features Stephen Graham (who previously appeared on the Scummy Man DVD and the &quot;When the Sun Goes Down&quot; video) as a clown. The music video premiered in the UK at 23:40, 5 June 2007 on Channel 4, and was available online the next day.\n\nThe music video is based around a fight between a group of clowns and a group of non-clowns at an abandoned warehouse. The presumed leaders of the two groups have a flashback showing that they were friends when they were young children. During the flashback, photos of the band as young children are shown. Throughout the fight, each group leader attempts to kill the other. As the music video climaxes, the non-clown leader tries to run over the clown leader. However the clown leader notices that the non-clown leader's car (with the non-clown leader inside) has been leaking fuel and drops his cigarette lighter. The car quickly catches fire and the clown leader looks on as his former friend burns and the music video ends.\n\nThe video is loosely inspired by the poem &quot;Out of Control Circus&quot; by John Cooper Clarke. Turner says he's a fan and gets lyrical inspiration from Clarke. The poem is also printed inside the CD release of &quot;Fluorescent Adolescent.&quot; The lines such as &quot;out of control fairground&quot; and &quot;homicidal clowns&quot; support this.\n\nThe video was preceded by a warning of violent images. In an MTV interview, Turner stated that the music video &quot;is the best thing we've ever done&quot; while Jamie Cook hailed it as &quot;...probably one of the best videos in the last, like, 10 years&quot;.\n\nThe song has received a 9/10 rating from Planet Sound, becoming Arctic Monkeys' first single to do so since &quot;I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor&quot;.\n\nArctic Monkeys are an English indie rock band formed in 2002 in High Green, a suburb of Sheffield. The band consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, lead/rhythm guitar), Jamie Cook (rhythm/lead guitar), Nick O'Malley (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Matt Helders (drums, backing vocals). Former member Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released.\n\nThe band's debut album became the fastest-selling debut album in British music history, surpassing Elastica's self-titled album and remains the fastest-selling debut album by a group in the UK. The band have won five Brit AwardsÃ¢â‚¬â€winning Best British Group twice, and have twice been nominated for Grammy Awards. The band also won the Mercury Prize for their debut album, in addition to receiving two nominations in 2007 and 2013.\n\nArctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first group of acts to come to the public attention via the Internet (fan-based sites rather than from the band), with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. The band are also regarded as one of the most prominent bands to be part of the post-punk revival in the UK, after achieving commercial success and spawning two number one singles with their debut album.\n(video has a 5 semi-transparent blue dots at the bottom right)\n\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_Adolescent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_Adolescent&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JaeNjaAFD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JaeNjaAFD&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 6000kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:02:52\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
