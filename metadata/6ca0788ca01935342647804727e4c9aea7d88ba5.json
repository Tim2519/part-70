Reinert (Author)\nHardcover: 456 pages\nPublisher: Harvard University Press (November 16, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0674061519\nISBN-13: 978-0674061514\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description\nPublication Date: November 16, 2011\nHistorians have traditionally turned to free trade and laissez faire to explain the development of political economy during the Enlightenment. Reinert argues that economic emulation was the prism through which philosophers, ministers, reformers, and merchants thought about imperialism, economics, industry, and reform in the early modern period.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nIt is rare to read a work of such originality and creativity, as well as breadth of ambition: With Reinert's evidence in hand, the entire history of economic thought and the origins of imperial industrialism will have to be reconsidered. (Jacob Soll, Rutgers University)\n\nTranslating Empire convincingly argues that the development of eighteenth-century political economy must be understood in the context of the often brutal rivalries unfolding in Europe and its colonial peripheries. It is a welcome antidote to the historical literature that has used the discourse of free trade to explain Enlightenment-era political economy. (Paul Cheney, University of Chicago)\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nSophus A.
