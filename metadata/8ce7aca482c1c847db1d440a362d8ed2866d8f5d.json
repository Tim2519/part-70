We'll learn everything from how to set up our animation preferences and create key frames, to learning how animation can be modified from Maya's Time Slider and Graph Editor. We'll learn how to animate objects along a path, how to work non-destructively with animation layers, how to draw inside of our viewport with Maya's Grease Pencil tool, and how to animate with constraints. We'll even learn how to transfer animation between characters with the help of a few Character Sets and the Trax Editor. By the end, you'll have the understanding you need to animate comfortably inside of Maya.
