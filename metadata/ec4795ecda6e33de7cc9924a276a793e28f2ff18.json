Was it just a story or did Hitler's daughter really exist? And If you were Hitler's daughter, would all the horror that occurred be your fault, too? Do things that happened a long time ago still matter? First published in 1999, HITLER'S DAUGHTER has sold over 100,000 copies in Australia alone and has received great critical acclaim, both in Australia and the twelve counties where it has been published. HITLER'S DAUGHTER has also won or been shortlisted for 23 awards, both in Australia and internationally, including winner of the 2000 Children's Book Council of Australia Book of the Year for Younger Readers. HITLER'S DAUGHTER has also been dramatised by the MonkeyBaa Theatre, and in 2007 won the Helpmann award for Best Presentation for Children and the Drovers Award for Touring Excellence.
