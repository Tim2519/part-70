Youtube is forced to comply.\n\nThe full movie is available here:\nfor almost 2 years without any issues to the uploader.\n\nBut Paramount_VFP has decided to block the above report about the movie; similar ties to banking mistakes and current events.\n\n&quot;It's A Wonderful Lie&quot; 100 Years of the Fed\n\nQuoted from prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv:\n\n&quot;This is a great example of how CSIPA and SOPA would legalize this misappropriation of copyright enforcement that these companies are currently engaging in.\n\nVideos on Youtube are being taken down completely because of mere accusations that they violate copyrights, regardless if the copyright claim is completely unfounded and bogus.\n\nThis was a pure political move meant to censor our powerful report exposing the truth on the fractional-reserve, fiat banking system. The full version of It's A Wonderful Life has been available on YouTube since Feb. 2012 and has over 700,000 views, but YouTube has not taken it down. That's because the real agenda is not copyright enforcement but rather it's about censoring the truth and protecting the global cartels within the state-corporate nexus.\n\nWe aired our review on the Dec. 24 edition of Alex Jones Show and on the Infowars Nightly News and it is clearly covered by fair use because it analyzes a cultural phenomenon and its historical roots. It's a wonderful life -- for the banksters that brought our country under so much tyranny that could never exist under a system of sound money.\n\nBecause our film review is so effective, they took it down. But here it is again in full.&quot;\n\nMr. Henry F. Potter, the president of the Building and Loan Association in the 1946 film It's a Wonderful Life, has very striking similarities to the modern day banksters working through the Federal Reserve to sap the nation's wealth.\nAs we look back over the past hundred years, America has experienced the Great Depression, multiple recessions, stagflation and the loss of 99% of the dollarÃŠÂ¼s purchasing power -- none of it wouldÃŠÂ¼ve been possible without the Federal Reserve, creating bubbles and bursting them, enslaving us with debt and destroying our purchasing power and our ability to save through inflation.\nYes, itÃŠÂ¼s been a wonderful lie Ã¢â‚¬â€ for the banksters.\n\nAnd many Americans are left like George Bailey. Facing the collapse of their dreams and financial ruin.\n\nThere are striking parallels in Frank CapraÃŠÂ¼s ItÃŠÂ¼s a Wonderful Life to lies and tricks of the modern banker elite. Human nature doesnÃŠÂ¼t change and the greedy elite of 1913 and 2013 look much like Potter.\n\nPlease spread the message and make this film go viral.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bdf45f08ba25d0f746bc15a2c295997d504ae74","amp;dn":"Its+A+Wonderful+Life%28LIE%29+Report+Infowars+HD+Censored.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bdf45f08ba25d0f746bc15a2c295997d504ae74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,223,69,240,139,162,93,15,116,107,193,90,44,41,89,151,213,4,174,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
