Truman claimed Miles and Aaron were behind the store bombing. Rachel tells Charlie that the Patriots will never stop looking for them unless they kill Horn first. After realizing the Patriot HQ is in the town paper factory, they devise a plan send Rachel to drop poison gas into the factory. Monroe, Aaron, and Cynthia are at a location waiting for Miles to come for them. Cynthia asks Aaron if he killed Carl, her ex-husband, and he says he did but he can't control his powers. Aaron breaks down in tears and asks Cynthia to leave him alone. They are discovered by Patriot soldiers sent by Horn, which Monroe attempts to fight off. On the verge of being overwhelmed by too many Patriots, Monroe flees, leaving Aaron and Cynthia to be captured. Miles calls off the mission when Gene enters the factory, but Rachel continues on anyway. As Rachel prepares to drop the poison, Aaron and Cynthia are led into the factory. Miles stops her just in time. Inside the factory, a drugged Aaron begs Horn to let Cynthia go. Cynthia realizes Gene is there and realizes he is collaborating with the Patriots. Horn refuses to let her go, saying she is assurance that Aaron will not torch the factory, and order Gene to leave. As Cynthia sits in a cell, she hears Aaron screaming from being tortured by Horn. Horn observes AaronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skin healing when cut. Miles, Rachel, and Charlie kidnap Gene and question him. He says the Patriots were the ones who gave him the medicine way back when and he took it. Truman shows up at their place demanding they all come out. Gene emerges, alone, and holds a knife to Truman's throat. The soldiers chase Miles, Rachel, and Charlie. Truman holds a gun to Gene's head and takes him back to the factory. Horn brings Cynthia into the room to see if Aaron can heal her when they cut her. Aaron screams as they stab her in the back and the fire flashes. In North Carolina, Neville walks into a Patriot camp to see Commander Roger Allenford. When asked his business, Neville holds up a ring. He convinces Allenford that although the commanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife is alive, she is an enemy of the Patriots. Neville says if Allenford brings his own wife in for justice, it would raise his career in the eyes of the Patriots. Neville further convinces the commander later that bringing her in would ultimately protect AllenfordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son and the commanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. At the barn where she is being held captive, she asks him to kill them and run away, and he says there is no place to run to and shoots her.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:374d555cbca5a8c540b253394707f618256d3902","amp;dn":"Revolution.2012.S02E08.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"374d555cbca5a8c540b253394707f618256d3902","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,77,85,92,188,165,168,197,64,178,83,57,71,7,246,24,37,109,57,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
