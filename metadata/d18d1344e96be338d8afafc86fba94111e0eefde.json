Cable is an embittered Confederate soldier who returns from the war to reclaim his Arizona homestead from rebel pioneers who sympathize with the Union war effort. Desperate to rebuild the life he once knew, Cable ultimately joins forces with Vern Kidston, his Union adversary to make a last stand for the one thing worth fighting for -- his family.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d18d1344e96be338d8afafc86fba94111e0eefde","amp;dn":"Last+Stand+at+Saber+River++%28Western+1997%29++Tom+Selleck%2C+Suzy+Ami","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d18d1344e96be338d8afafc86fba94111e0eefde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,141,19,68,233,107,227,56,216,175,175,200,111,186,148,17,30,14,239,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
