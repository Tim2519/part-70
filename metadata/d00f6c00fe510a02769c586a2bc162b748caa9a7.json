Tracy has almost 40 yrs experience responding to disasters all over the world. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m in the medical profession. I have never seen a medical instructor like Tracy. I thought I was prepared. I was wrong.\n\nIt is not always what you see that is the greatest danger, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see. And that can get a loved one killed and/or yourself killed by doing the wrong thing. You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know.\n\nWarning-Tracy is corny at times. But it makes you remember what is taught.\nAnother Warning- Tracy is a Believer. He believes that in whatever situation he is going into- it is in GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hands. He believes in prayer. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see him on public TV or CNN. We need more people like Tracy.\n\nIf you find God or Jesus offensive, you might not be ready to watch this presentation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d00f6c00fe510a02769c586a2bc162b748caa9a7","amp;dn":"Preparing+for+Disasters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d00f6c00fe510a02769c586a2bc162b748caa9a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,15,108,0,254,81,10,2,118,156,88,106,43,193,98,183,72,202,169,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
