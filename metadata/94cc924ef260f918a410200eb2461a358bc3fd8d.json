But Cullen was no mercy killer, nor was he a simple monster. He was a favorite son, husband, beloved father, best friend, and celebrated caregiver. Implicated in the deaths of as many as 300 patients, he was also perhaps the most prolific serial killer in American history.\n\nCullenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murderous career in the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most trusted profession spanned sixteen years and nine hospitals across New Jersey and Pennsylvania. When, in March of 2006, Charles Cullen was marched from his final sentencing in an Allentown, Pennsylvania, courthouse into a waiting police van, it seemed certain that the chilling secrets of his life, career, and capture would disappear with him. Now, in a riveting piece of investigative journalism nearly ten years in the making, journalist Charles Graeber presents the whole story for the first time. Based on hundreds of pages of previously unseen police records, interviews, wire-tap recordings and videotapes, as well as exclusive jailhouse conversations with Cullen himself and the confidential informant who helped bring him down, THE GOOD NURSE weaves an urgent, terrifying tale of murder, friendship, and betrayal.\n\nGraeberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s portrait of Cullen depicts a surprisingly intelligent and complicated young man whose promising career was overwhelmed by his compulsion to kill, and whose shy demeanor masked a twisted interior life hidden even to his family and friends. Were it not for the hardboiled, unrelenting work of two former Newark homicide detectives racing to put together the pieces of CullenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s professional past, and a fellow nurse willing to put everything at risk, including her job and the safety of her children, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no telling how many more lives could have been lost.\n\nIn the tradition of In Cold Blood, THE GOOD NURSE does more than chronicle CullenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deadly career and the breathless efforts to stop him; it paints an incredibly vivid portrait of madness and offers a penetrating look inside AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s medical system. Harrowing and irresistibly paced, this book will make you look at medicine, hospitals, and the people who work in them, in an entirely different way.\n\n\nabout author :-\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1363968647p5/6172406.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1363968647p5/6172406.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCharles Graeber is an award-winning journalist and New York Times bestselling author of THE GOOD NURSE: A True Story of Medicine, Madness, and Murder (published by Twelve). \n\nHe is also a contributor to numerous publications including Wired, GQ, The New Yorker, New York Magazine, Vogue, Outside Magazine, MenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Journal, Bloomberg Businessweek, Travel + Leisure, and The New York Times, and an occasional guest on CNN, NPR, and other radio programs.
