The great saxophonist is joined by either Wild Bill Davis or (on four of the nine songs) the obscure organist Ray Jackson, either Kenny Burrell or Mundell Lowe on guitar, Wendell Marshall, Jack Lesberg or Richard Davis on bass, and Bobby Donaldson or Osie Johnson on drums. The music is fairly typical for a Hodges date, with four Ellington standards, some blues and some basic originals. In a few spots, the organists really do a good job of filling in for the Ellington Orchestra. Tasty and swinging music.
