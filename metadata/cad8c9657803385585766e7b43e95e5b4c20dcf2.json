West\n\n\nabout book :-\n\nA leader of a global superpower is betrayed by his mistress, who makes public the sordid details of their secret affair. His wife stands by as he denies the charges. Debates over definitions of moral leadership ensue. Sound familiar? If you guessed Clinton and Lewinsky, try again. This incident involved former Japanese prime minister Sosuke Uno and a geisha.\n\nIn Secrets, Sex, and Spectacle, Mark D. West organizes the seemingly random worlds of Japanese and American scandalÃ¢â‚¬â€from corporate fraud to baseball cheaters, political corruption to celebrity sexcapadesÃ¢â‚¬â€to explore well-ingrained similarities and contrasts in law and society. In Japan and the United States, legal and organizational rules tell us what kind of behavior is considered scandalous. When Japanese and American scandal stories differ, those rulesÃ¢â‚¬â€rules that define whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s public and whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s private, rules that protect injuries to dignity and honor, and rules about sex, to name a fewÃ¢â‚¬â€often help explain the differences. In the cases of Clinton and Uno, the rules help explain why the media didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cover UnoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s affair, why UnoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife apologized on her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behalf, and why UnoÃ¢â‚¬â€and not ClintonÃ¢â‚¬â€resigned.\n\nSecrets, Sex, and Spectacle offers a novel approach to viewing the phenomenon of scandalÃ¢â‚¬â€one that will be applauded by anyone who has obsessed over (or ridiculed) these public episodes.\n\n\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cad8c9657803385585766e7b43e95e5b4c20dcf2","amp;dn":"Secrets%2C+Sex%2C+and+Spectacle+prabhu_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cad8c9657803385585766e7b43e95e5b4c20dcf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,216,201,101,120,3,56,85,133,118,110,123,67,233,94,91,76,32,220,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
