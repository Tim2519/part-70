The Four Mints were one of the most influential local group harmony outfits of their era andÃ¢â‚¬â€with assistance from Columbus doyen and Capsoul purveyor Bill MossÃ¢â‚¬â€among the few to release a full length LP. The roster of backing musicians hired to provide aural landscaping reads like a Midwest super-group, with surprising appearances from Indianapolis-based vibraphonist Billy Wooten and drummer Bobby Allen of the Fabulous Originals from Dayton, Ohio. And though most of the material on 1973Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Gently had been previously released as 45s, the collectionÃ¢â‚¬â€five singles and one priceless track saved from the scrap heapÃ¢â‚¬â€gives witness to a world-class vocal quartet at its professional and intuitive peak. Under the watchful eye of arranger and mega-talent Dean Francis, the Four Mints pour forth from your speakers soulful, faithful and clear, but perhaps more importantly, intrinsically homegrown and utterly honest. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.numerogroup.com/products/the-four-mints-gently-down-your-stream&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.numerogroup.com/products/the-four-mints-gently-down-your-stream&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40f32f151c1cb5fcc21b19c213b3683ad58578ad","amp;dn":"The+Four+Mints+-+Gently+Down+Your+Stream++%28NUM-AST2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40f32f151c1cb5fcc21b19c213b3683ad58578ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,243,47,21,28,28,181,252,194,27,25,194,19,179,104,58,213,133,120,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
