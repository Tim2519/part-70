It's the day she'll marry Micha, the love of her life, the light that guided her out of the darkness. It looks like it will be the perfect Christmas-until an unexpected package arrives with a harsh reminder of Ella's past. Suddenly Ella doesn't feel as confident about her future. Can she really have a &quot;happily-ever-after&quot; if she's never even seen one?\n\nMicha will stand by Ella no matter what she's going through-though he worries that she might leave him standing at the altar again. When he's offered a once-in-a-lifetime chance to tour with his favorite bands for three months, Micha knows he can't leave Ella behind. But can he ask her to uproot her life to join him on the road?\n\nNow Ella and Micha must find a way to balance their fears, their dreams, and their love . . . if they ever want to hear wedding bells.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96143fd8549ae14208d20801e8a7f3c6e9b05c18","amp;dn":"The+Ever+After+of+Ella+and+Micha+%5BThe+Secret%2C+%234%5D+-+Jessica+Sore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96143fd8549ae14208d20801e8a7f3c6e9b05c18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,20,63,216,84,154,225,66,8,210,8,1,232,167,243,198,233,176,92,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
