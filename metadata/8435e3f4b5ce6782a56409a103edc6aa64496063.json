Unveiling the Man of Sin explores Dr. VanKoevering's research into who this man is and his role in the world scene!\n\nNote from EternalRhythmFlow:\n\nIn light of the unbiblical, uneducated and ridiculously sensational &quot;Obama is the Antichrist&quot; internet craze which no prophecy teacher worth his salt believes, I want to encourage my educated viewers to study the biblical facts about the Antichrist's scriptural qualifications. I think you will be amazed at what Dr. VanKoevering has put together. Food for thought. Thanks for watching. Enjoy!\n\nFor your own research:\n\nBiographical Info - H.R.H.

Silly thought, isn't it?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nREVELATION ABOUT THE PESTILENCE AND THE PUNISHMENT FROM GOD UPON THE CHURCH AS A RESULT OF SIN:\nThe LORD GOD Almighty; though He is the God of Mercy; He is also the GOD of Judgment and Wrath: Jdg 10:7 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.\nHe still punishes when we sin against Him. He still brings calamity, desolation and disaster when His people and the church disobey Him. WHY? BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS THAT SIN WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED: (Jer_25:29 For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts.\nRom 2:8 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, Rom 2:9 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;\nPro_11:21 Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.)\nDavid has sinned against God by numbering the people of Israel without God's instructions. The LORD came to Him and asked Him to choose three things: 7 years famine; 3 months of attack and dominion by His enemies or three days of pestilence in the Land?? David being wise chose to fall in the Hands of God in who are mercies in great abundance.\nDISASTER OF SIN:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sin against GOD brings curses and pestilences from GOD\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sin against GOD makes God to attack the sinner with pestilence and various calamities\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sin against GOD triggers God's wrath and divine destruction against those who have committed and many times even affecting the innocent in that family, tribe or nation\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sin against GOD bring all curses written in Deut. 28:15-68 to befall upon the committer of atrocities\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sin against GOD triggers the launch of all agents of disaster and destruction like famine, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornados, floods, fires, diseases, strange sickness and pestilences that human beings cannot comprehend\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sin against God triggers punishment for many years visiting iniquities upon the 3rd and 4th generation of that tribe or family\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sin against God brings calamities to the sinner's soul and invasion of spiritual enemies into his/her life ex: demons, evil spirits, spiritual dragons, serpents, owls and evil birds and HIGH LEVEL SPIRITUAL demonic entities begin to destroy him/her spiritually and even physically.\n\nCONSEQUENCES OF THE SIN COMMITTED BY THE CHURCH\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sin committed by the Church as a corporate action, triggers God's Wrath upon the Nations and the world in deeper instance because it is the spouse of GOD that has committed such disaster\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ When the Church sins, GOD brings down tremendous and enormous calamities and punishments such as:\nJdg_2:14 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.\n\n1. GOD handed the present Church to False Prophets, false Pastors and false evangelist\n2. GOD delivered the Church to wolves in sheep's clothing, to ravenous lions and dragons who has made the Church a business enterprises and profit making machines.\n\nJdg 3:8 Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.\n\n3. GOD handed over this prostitute wife to Witches and wizards preaching false grace and lying to her\n4. God divorced the Church and handed her over to her tormentors: Demonic anointed preachers and liars on the throne\nIsa 50:1 Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.\n5. The rise of multitude of prosperity and mammon lover preachers in the Church is the greatest sign of God's pestilence against this prostitute spouse of GOD(the fallen Church)\n6. The Pestilence of hunger of the word of God has hit the Church.\nAmo 8:11 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:\nAmo 8:12 And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.\n7. The Pestilence and destruction of the temple of God by darkness, prostitution and various mermaids have taken over and invaded the Church\n8. The Nations of the world are today suffering this turbulence in the whole world because of the Church which has decided to prostitute against her Husband- GOD the Father\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWE FOUND THE NEPHILIM:\nL.A.
