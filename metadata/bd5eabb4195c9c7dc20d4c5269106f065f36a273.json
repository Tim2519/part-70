It was recorded in late 2011 and early 2012 at Stratosphere Sound, New York City, with producer Alex Newport, who also produced WreckonomicsÃ¢â‚¬â€the EP of bassist Gordon Moakes' side project, Young Legionnaire. It was released on 20 August 2012 on independent label Frenchkiss Records,[4] and was made available to stream the week preceding its release. The album peaked at number three in the UK Albums Chart and in the United States, it reached number thirty six on the Billboard 200.[5][6] Despite four years of hiatus making this the largest gap between album releases, the band recorded the album using a more guitar-oriented sound reminiscent of their debut album, Silent Alarm.\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] So He Begins To Lie\n[02] 3 X 3\n[03] Octopus\n[04] Real Talk\n[05] Kettling\n[06] Day Four\n[07] Coliseum\n[08] V.A.L.I.S\n[09] Team A\n[10] Truth\n[11] The Healing\n[12] We Are Not Good People\n[13] Mean\n[14] Leaf Skeleton\n\nCD - Play Time - 00h:50m:31s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 140mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
