Our culture obsessively promotes the pursuit of money, success and self-improvement. At the end of each activity-jammed day, though, we collapse into bed discouraged by everything we have not checked off on our to-do lists, in despair that whatever we have accomplished is never enough. Worse still, when our dreams become derailed by the inherent tragedies of lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€job loss, financial peril, sickness, or the death of a loved oneÃ¢â‚¬â€we feel devastated by the pain and injustice of it all.\n \nNationally renowned author, therapist, and minister Wayne Muller offers healing for the perpetually stressed in A Life of Being, Having, and Doing Enough. By learning compassion and mercy for ourselves and by recognizing what is most profoundly true about who we are and what we need, we can gain the self-acceptance so that whatever we choose to do, in this moment, it is wholly enough.\n \nMuller mixes the writings of great spiritual and political leaders with inspirational anecdotes from his own life, inviting us to derive more satisfaction from less and pull gratitude out of the ashes of grief. The answer to what he describes as &quot;authentic happiness&quot; lies not in seeing the glass as half full instead of half empty. In reality, he writes, the glass is always half full and half empty. The world is neither broken nor whole, but eternally engaged in rhythms between joy and sorrow. With Muller's guidance, we may find ourselves on the most courageous spiritual pilgrimage of our lives.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea3dbcbe84fcc2be546849042731a9666330cc99","amp;dn":"A+Life+of+Being%2C+Having%2C+and+Doing+Enough-Wayne+Muller-Epub-Yeal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea3dbcbe84fcc2be546849042731a9666330cc99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,61,188,190,132,252,194,190,84,104,73,4,39,49,169,102,99,48,204,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
