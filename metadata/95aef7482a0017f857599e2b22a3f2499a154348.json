Includes a lot of rare and hard-to-find EP's that you just can't find anymore. A lot of these are not my own but have been sitting in my collection for a long time now... had to do some serious hunting to get my hands on some of these albums. I take no credit for ripping any of these at all.\n\nQuality:\nMost are 320 kbps but some of the rarer ones are VBR and I think one of them is even 128 kbps but this.\n\nNotes: \nI threw in my personal collection of rarities and b-sides, many of these are YouTube rips at 128 kbps and/or VBR.\nAll tracks come with imbedded album artwork with clean edges.\nAll tracks come with correct and complete ID3 tags such as track number, disc number, composer, genre, album, artist, year...\nThis is complete up until 2013. If you're reading this down the line and there's newer albums out: look at the uploaded date, that's why they're not included.\n\n\nOfficial Albums List:\n(1987) Screaming Life*\n(1988) Fopp*\n(1988) Ultramega OK\n(1989) Flower*\n(1989) Louder Than Love\n(1990) Louder Than Live*\n(1990) Loudest Love\n(1990) Screaming Life/Fopp**\n(1991) Badmotorfinger\n(1992) Satanoscillatemymetallicsonatas*\n(1994) Superunknown\n(1995) Songs from the Superunknown*\n(1996) Down on the Upside\n(1997) A-Sides**\n(2010) Telephantasm**\n(2011) Before the Doors: Live on I-5 Soundcheck***\n(2011) Live on I-5\n(2012) King Animal\n(2013) King Animal Demos**\n\nUnofficial Albums List:\n(2013) In Disguises No One Knows: The B-Sides of Soundgarden\n\n\n*   = EP\n**  = Complication\n*** = Live","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95aef7482a0017f857599e2b22a3f2499a154348","amp;dn":"Soundgarden%3A+A+Complete+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95aef7482a0017f857599e2b22a3f2499a154348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,174,247,72,42,0,23,248,87,89,158,43,34,163,242,73,154,21,67,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
