Other reviews are 5 star positive. - Big Papi\n\nBy MJAlaska\n&quot;Capturing the magic and celebration of the holiday season, Enchanted Christmas highlights the gifted harp arrangements of Anna Maria Mendieta along with her new chamber ensemble featuring strings, woodwinds and beautiful angelic soundscapes.&quot; ~ CD cover\n\nAngelic soundscapes? Apparently, that is code for synthesizer. The orchestration, according to the CD's liner notes, is performed by &quot;Stevan Pasero's New Chamber Ensemble featuring Don Hariss and Paul Rice.&quot; There are no listings for any string or woodwind performers on the CD cover or in its liner notes. Upon listening to &quot;Enchanted Christmas&quot; in its entirety, it is obvious that the 'ensemble' comprises of keyboards and/or synthesizer. Pity, really, since Anna Maria Mendieta is an accomplished harpist and is served poorly by the accompanying 'ensemble.'\nMendieta's mastery can be heard on her excellent solo performances of the graceful &quot;Concert Variations on 'Adeste Fidelis'&quot; and the serenely beautiful &quot;Canon In D Major.&quot; Other selections from &quot;Enchanted Christmas&quot; are awash with the 'angelic soundscape' and 'ensemble' ( e.g., &quot;Ave Maria,&quot; &quot;Lo, How A Rose,&quot; &quot;Carol Of The Bells&quot;) and tend to overwhelm, rather than compliment Mendieta's artistry.\nHowever, if you are a fan of David Arkenstone's quieter Christmas Carol interpretations in particular, or a New Age Christmas music devotee in general, you may find this CD very much to your liking. Harp purists or traditionalists, take heed: disappointment may await you.\n\nTrack List:\n\n1) Angels We Have Heard On High 3:12\n2) Carol Of The Bells 4:52\n3) Jesu, Joy Of Man's Desiring 3:41\n4) Coventry Carol 5:04\n5) It Came Upon A Midnight Clear 3:09\n6) Concert Variations On &quot;Adeste Fidelis&quot; 4:41\n7) Silent Night 3:38\n8) GesÃƒÂ¹ Bambino 3:18\n9) Ave Maria 4:51\n10) Lo, How A Rose 4:03\n11) Canon In D Major 5:55\n12) Away In A Manger 3:08\n13) Bring A Torch, Jeanette Isabella 4:01\n14) A Ceremony Of Carols (Interlude, Op. 28) 3:35\n15) Amazing Grace 2:15","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ea87455f6f9816254a7e0e7cad44130569f01c6","amp;dn":"Enchanted+Christmas+-+Harp+and+Chamber+1993","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ea87455f6f9816254a7e0e7cad44130569f01c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,168,116,85,246,249,129,98,84,167,224,231,202,212,65,48,86,159,1,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
