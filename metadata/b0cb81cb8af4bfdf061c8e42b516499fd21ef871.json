Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\ndescription:\n\nGenerally recognized as one of the most important novels of the tumultuous 1960s, The Man Who Cried I Am vividly evokes the harsh era of segregation that presaged the expatriation of African-American intellectuals. Through the eyes of journalist Max Reddick, and with penetrating fictional portraits of Richard Wright and James Baldwin, among other historical figures, John A Williams reveals the hope, courage, and bitter disappointment of the civil-rights era. Infused with powerful artistry, searing anger, as well as insight, humanity, and vision, The Man Who Cried I Am is a classic of postwar American literature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0cb81cb8af4bfdf061c8e42b516499fd21ef871","amp;dn":"John+A.+Williams+-+The+Man+Who+Cried+I+Am+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0cb81cb8af4bfdf061c8e42b516499fd21ef871","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,203,129,203,138,244,191,223,6,28,142,66,181,22,73,159,210,30,248,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
