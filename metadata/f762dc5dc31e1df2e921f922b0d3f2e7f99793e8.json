It featured Brian Downey and ex-Thin Lizzy guitarists Brian Robertson and Eric Bell as well as ongoing Lizzy member Scott Gorham.[1] The concert was simply called &quot;The Boy Is Back in Town&quot;, with the &quot;One Night in Dublin&quot; title a change made for the DVD. On 21 April 2009 it was also released on Blu-ray format.\n\nThe show was typical in several ways of both Thin Lizzy shows and Gary Moore ones. As always with Thin Lizzy, &quot;Cowboy Song&quot; was followed by &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;, and &quot;Whisky in the Jar&quot; is part of the encore. When Moore covered &quot;Don't Believe a Word&quot; as a solo artist he slowed it down into a ballad; here he begins performing his version before switching mid-song to the Thin Lizzy-style rock song. As is always so with Moore, he closed with &quot;Parisienne Walkways&quot;. Robertson, Gorham and Bell only performed songs they originally performed with Thin Lizzy. The DVD also contains the unveiling of a statue of Phil Lynott in Grafton Street, Dublin earlier that day, and rehearsals and interviews with Thin Lizzy members who featured in this concert.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f762dc5dc31e1df2e921f922b0d3f2e7f99793e8","amp;dn":"Gary+Moore+%26amp%3B+Friends+-+Tribute+to+Phill+Lynott.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f762dc5dc31e1df2e921f922b0d3f2e7f99793e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,98,220,93,195,30,29,242,233,33,249,34,176,211,242,231,249,151,147,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
