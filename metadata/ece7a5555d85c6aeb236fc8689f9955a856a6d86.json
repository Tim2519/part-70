Cookbook \nby Suzanne Goin\nKnopf  | October 2013 | ISBN-10: 030795823X | ePUB | 418 pages | 20.1 mb\n\nSince her James Beard Award-winning first book, Sunday Suppers at Lucques, Suzanne Goin and her Los Angeles empire of restaurants have blossomed and she has been lauded as one of the best chefs in the country. Now, she is bringing us the recipes from her sophomore restaurant, A.O.C., turning the small-plate, shared-style dishes that she made so famous into main courses for the home chef. \nBut The A.O.C. Cookbook is much more than just a collection of recipes. Because Goin is a born teacher with a gift for pairing seasonal flavors, this book is full of wonderful, eye-opening information about the ingredients that she holds dear. She takes the time to talk you through each one of her culinary decisions, explaining her palate and how she gets the deeply developed flavor profiles, which make even the simplest dishes sing. More than anything, Goin wants you to understand her techniques so you enjoy yourself in the kitchen and have no problem achieving restaurant-quality results right at home.\nAnd because wine and cheese are at the heart of A.O.C., there are two exciting additions. Caroline Styne, GoinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s business partner and the wine director for her restaurants, presents a specific wine pairing for each dish. Styne explains why each varietal works well with the ingredients and which flavors sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trying to highlight, and she gives you room to experiment as wellÃ¢â‚¬â€showing how to shape the wine to your own palate. Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just grabbing a glass to go with dinner or planning an entire menu, her expert notes are a real education in wine. At the back of the book, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find GoinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amazing glossary of cheesesÃ¢â‚¬â€all featured at A.O.C.Ã¢â‚¬â€along with the notes that are given to the waitstaff, explaining the sources, flavor profiles, and pairings.   \nWith more than 125 full-color photographs, The A.O.C. Cookbook brings Suzanne GoinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dishes to life as she continues to invite us into her kitchen and divulge the secrets about what makes her food so irresistibly delicious.
