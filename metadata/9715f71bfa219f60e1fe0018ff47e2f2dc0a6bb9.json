Owens described Broken Dreams Club as a &quot;snapshot of the horizon&quot; and &quot;a taste of things to come.&quot;\nBroken Dreams Club was the first Girls release to feature a full band (Girls was previously a collaboration between Owens and JR White). Some songs, such as &quot;Substance,&quot; were written before Album's release. Caitlin Upton's infamous response at Miss Teen USA 2007 inspired the EP's closing track &quot;Carolina.&quot; Owens felt much sympathy for Upton after seeing all the negative publicity she was receiving and wrote the song &quot;about wanting to save someone from the ravenous wolves of just the way the modern world is.&quot;\n\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written and composed by Christopher Owens. \n\nNo.\tTitle\t                        Length\t\n1.\t&quot;The Oh So Protective One&quot;  \t3:36\n2.\t&quot;Heartbreaker&quot;  \t        4:02\n3.\t&quot;Broken Dreams Club&quot;      \t5:12\n4.\t&quot;Alright&quot;  \t                4:46  \n5.\t&quot;Substance&quot;  \t                4:48\n6.\t&quot;Carolina&quot;  \t                7:43\n\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\n\nGirls\n\nGarett Goddard - Drums, Vocals (Background)\nMatthew Kallman - Farfisa Organ, Organ, Piano (Electric)\nRyan Lynch - Guitar\nChristopher Owens - Composer, Cover Art, Guitar, Horn Arrangements, Mixing, Percussion, Photography, Vocals\nChet Jr. White - Bass, Horn Arrangements, Percussion, Producer, Synthesizer\n\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nAra Anderson - Horn\nJoel Behrman - Horn\nDee Dee - Vocals (Background)\nRichard Dodd - Mastering\nDan Eisenberg - Hammond B3, Piano\nRick Elmore - Trombone\nCorey Lee Granet - Guitar\nTom Heyman - Pedal Steel\nDave McNair - Mastering\nMike Olmos - Trumpet\nJ.J.
