In a story reminiscent of the Asterix books, Dan Hancox explores the reality behind the community where no one has a mortgage, sport is played in a stadium emblazoned with a huge mural of Che Guevara, and there are monthly &quot;Red Sundays&quot; where everyone works together to clean up the neighbourhood. In particular he tells the story of the village mayor, Sanchez Gordillo, who in 2012 became a household name in Spain after leading raids on local supermarkets to feed the Andalucian unemployed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:014d797a7a59aedf92b856da89f766885db5a052","amp;dn":"The+Village+Against+the+World+by+Dan+Hancox","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"014d797a7a59aedf92b856da89f766885db5a052","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,77,121,122,122,89,174,223,146,184,86,218,137,247,102,136,93,181,160,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
