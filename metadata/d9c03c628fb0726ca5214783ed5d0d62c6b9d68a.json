A very brief announcement: \n\nQuirky is a Linux distribution that lives up to its name &quot;quirky&quot;. A number of unusual ideas are experimented with, as described in the detailed Release Notes. \nQuirky 6.0 started the ball rolling with the feature-set proposed for the 6.x series, now 6.1 adds the comprehensive upgrade/downgrade/rollback/recovery mechanisms. In essence, these are in three sections: \n1. Rigorous handling of package uninstallation, such that the system can never be broken. \n2. System snapshots, with history, allowing recovery to any earlier state. \n3. Simple version upgrade, with Service Packs. \n\nThe above three new features are explained further in earlier posts to my blog, read the Announcement and detailed Release Notes, which has appropriate links to my blog:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://distro.ibiblio.org/quirky/quirky6/x86/quirky-6.1/release-Quirky-6.1.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://distro.ibiblio.org/quirky/quirky6/x86/quirky-6.1/release-Quirky-6.1.htm&lt;/a&gt; \n\nThe Release Notes also explain how to download and install Quirky 6.1, please read. There are a few choices. If you already have 6.0.1 installed, there is a Service Pack PET. For new installations, there are two scripts, for installing either to a Flash drive or a hard-drive partition. Or, there is an easy ready-to-go image for a 8GB Flash drive, that just needs to be copied to the drive. \n\nFor those who are into compiling source packages, the &quot;devx&quot; is no longer a SFS file. SFS files are no more, history, gone, kaput. They are now PETs. Again, the Release Notes explain this.[/quote]\nmore at [urlhttp://bkhome.org/news/?viewDetailed=00036[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9c03c628fb0726ca5214783ed5d0d62c6b9d68a","amp;dn":"quirky-6.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9c03c628fb0726ca5214783ed5d0d62c6b9d68a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,192,60,98,143,176,114,108,165,33,71,131,237,93,13,98,198,185,214,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
