Meanwhile, a painting of Sinan which was made while he was alive was discovered by chance in one of the miniatures brought from a library found in Ireland. Consequently, new details on Sinan was acquired. How did HÃƒÂ¼seyin Anka interpret Sinan in his mental image with the limited data of that time as a sculptor, who had the responsibility to make a sculpture of Sinan, by winning a competition arranged upon the order of AtatÃƒÂ¼rk to &quot;make a sculpture of Sinan&quot;. After reading the memories of Sinan and seeing the miniature of him, how did HÃƒÂ¼seyin Anka interpret and do it after 45 years old?\n\n&quot;Re-evaluation of Sinan Through HÃƒÂ¼seyin Anka&quot; is the outcome of the searches of the director to find an answer for these questions. In this documentary, HÃƒÂ¼seyin Anka, by working on a mud bust, reinterprets step by step the fifty-year period in which Sinan was a chief designer. This film is a phenomenon in which two artists, who came from a village and achieved a carrier with the state support, share their sorrow and question yesterday, today and tomorrow after 450 years by coming together in a workshop as the &quot;real&quot; artists who still perform their skills even in their 80s.\n\nBuy at http://www.mtvfilm.com/en/film/huseyin-anka/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9931617a3732f207f56ee7c48fd387bbd82ecd16","amp;dn":"Re-evaluation+of+Sinan+Through+Huseyin+Anka","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9931617a3732f207f56ee7c48fd387bbd82ecd16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,49,97,122,55,50,242,7,245,110,231,196,143,211,135,187,216,46,205,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
