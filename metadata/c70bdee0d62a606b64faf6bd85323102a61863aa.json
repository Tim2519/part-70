The end result is the same but the\njourney to that hellish destination is always different. The route can\nsometimes be straightforward enough, uncomplicated and not too\ndifficult to understand why some people travelled in that direction. At\nother times, the trip can be as complex and unfathomable as the\ntravellers themselves.\n\nSome of the leading players are, in truth, not so different from the\nrest of us. They have committed the ultimate crime in a moment of\ninsanity, a solitary out-of-character act which changes lives forever.\nIt is instantly regretted but as irreversible and final as the last breath\nof the person who perished. It is a route they are unlikely to take\nagain. Their meandering journey through life has merely sent them\ndown the wrong path on the wrong day, perhaps when they stopped\noff along the way for one drink too many.\n\nThe following pages contain some material which is not for the\nfaint-hearted. Murder is a messy business, however it happens, so\nthere are passages you are unlikely to read in a romantic novel.\nNothing has been included for gratuitous purposes and in some\ninstances the content has been diluted to avoid offence Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but not so\nseverely that distortion occurs. To understand the act, it is necessary\nto acknowledge the detail. For the same reason, there has been no\nreal painting on of false moustaches to disguise identities, except\nperhaps by omission and only then in the interests of fairness. The\nonly chapter containing a significant deviation is Ã¢â‚¬ËœBabes in the\nHouseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, where the names of all those involved have been changed.\nThey were made public at the time but, in the current spirit of\nprotecting juvenile offenders, it seemed preferable to omit them from\nthis account. Otherwise, the circumstances are just as they occurred.\nFew attempts were made to form judgements about the main players\nor to analyse the reasons for their extreme conduct, but in any\nvolume of this kind it would be impossible to avoid the occasional\npassing comment of some sort. None of that should prevent readers\nfrom arriving at their own conclusions or from trying to have a better\nunderstanding of what takes place in the dark corners of the places\nwhere we live. Or Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and perhaps a more difficult point Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to endeavour\nto make sense of the some of the unfathomable people who dwell\nwithin in our midst.\n\nThe true stories that lie ahead happen to be about a specific city.\nThey could have occurred anywhere.\n\nabout author :-\n\nAlexander McGregor has had a special interest in crime for most of his journalistic career. He was Chief Reporter on Dundee's daily newspapers, The Courier and The Evening Telegraph, and also a columnist. He was a contributor to the best-selling book Dundee: A Voyage of Discovery and has taken part in televised crime documentaries. He has also written a crime novel, Lawless.\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c70bdee0d62a606b64faf6bd85323102a61863aa","amp;dn":"The+Law+Killers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c70bdee0d62a606b64faf6bd85323102a61863aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,11,222,224,214,42,96,107,100,250,246,189,133,50,49,2,166,24,99,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
