But Lyssa feels lost and adrift in the rainy Northwest without her mom. And when she finds out that her old house in Texas is about to be bulldozed, something snaps inside her. Fiercely determined, Lyssa climbs onto her scooter and sets off cross-country to save her home.\n\nBeautifully written and sparkling with magic, Zip is a modern-day successor to Alice in Wonderland. It's a joyful Odyssey-esque journey that's perfect for the readers of Savvy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7be126237191d4b8a9ec6ac7f254f8ed811224c","amp;dn":"Zip+-+Ellie+Rollins.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7be126237191d4b8a9ec6ac7f254f8ed811224c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,190,18,98,55,25,29,75,138,158,198,172,127,37,79,142,216,17,34,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
