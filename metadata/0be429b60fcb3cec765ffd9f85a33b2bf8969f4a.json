The dog's first break came when he was asked to replace a camera-shy wolf in The Man From Hell's River (1922). The wolf was not performing properly for the director, but under the guidance of Duncan's voice commands, Rin Tin Tin was very easy to work with. When the film was completed the dog was billed as &quot;Rin Tan&quot;. Rin Tin Tin would be cast as a wolf or wolf-hybrid many times in his career because it was much more convenient for filmmakers to work with a trained dog. In another 1922 film titled My Dad, Rin Tin Tin picked up a small part as a household dog. The credits read: &quot;Rin Tin Tin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Played by himself&quot;.\n\nRin Tin Tin's first starring role was in Where the North Begins (1923), playing alongside silent screen actress Claire Adams. This film was a huge success and has often been credited with saving Warner Bros. from bankruptcy. It was followed by 24 more screen appearances. Each of these films was very popular, making such a profit for Warner Bros. that Rin Tin Tin was called &quot;the mortgage lifter&quot; by studio insiders. A young screenwriter named Darryl F. Zanuck was involved in creating stories for Rin Tin Tin; the success of the films raised him to the position of respected film producer.\n\nRin Tin Tin was much sought after and was signed for endorsement deals. He was featured in ads for Ken-L Ration, Ken-L-Biskit, and Pup-E-Crumbles. Warner Bros. got thousands of requests for publicity photographs of Rinty, which were signed with a paw print and a line written by Duncan: &quot;Most faithfully, Rin Tin Tin.&quot; In the 1920s, Rin Tin Tin's success for Warner Bros. inspired several imitations from other studios looking to cash in on his popularity, notably RKO's Ace the Wonder Dog, also a German Shepherd.  Around the world, Rin Tin Tin was extremely popular because, as a dog, he was equally well understood by all viewers. At the time, silent films were easily adapted for various countries by simply changing the language of the intertitles. Rin Tin Tin's films were widely distributed. By 1927, Rin Tin Tin was the most popular actor with the very sophisticated film audience in Berlin.\n\nAuthor Susan Orlean investigated the Hollywood legend that Rin Tin Tin received the most votes for Best Actor at the first Academy Award competition in 1929. Orlean says that the Academy wished to appear more serious, that they determined to have a human actor win the award. Rin Tin Tin was removed as a choice and the votes were cast once more: German actor Emil Jannings won the Best Actor award.\n\nAlthough primarily a star of silent films, Rin Tin Tin did appear in four sound features, including the 12-part Mascot Studios chapter-play The Lightning Warrior (1931), co-starring with Frankie Darro. In these films, vocal commands would have been picked up by the microphones, so Duncan likely guided Rin Tin Tin by hand signals.\n\nThe only serial in which a horse (Rex), a dog (Rin-Tin-Tin, Jr.) and a cross-eyed comedian (Ben Turpin) are billed above the hero (Bob Custer.) The first two are understandable---they were better actors than Custer. Rancher John Sheldon (Bob Custer)ropes and tames Rex (Rex, King of the Wild Horses)and discovers he is the fastest thing on four feet. When Lou Salters (Dick Alexander), a ranch hand employed by Sheldon, attempts to steal Rex to train him for the track, both Sheldon and his faithful dog Rinty (Rin-Tin-Tin Jr.)try to stop him. Sheldon is wounded and Salters gets away with the horse. Sheldon recovers from the wound and sets out in search of the thief. Enroute to the track where he thinks Salters has taken Rex, Sheldon meets Alice Ingram (Lucile Browne) and her father (Lafe McKee), a well-to-do rancher and race horse owner. They are too late to keep Salters from entering Rex in a race which, unfortunately for Salters, the horse wins. Frank Nolan (Dick Cramer) wants to buy the horse but his offer is refused. Co-conspiritator Jim Luger (Edmund Cobb) shoots Salter and he and Nolan lay the blame on Sheldon, who is having no luck at all in proving the horse rightfully belongs to him, other than calling a lot of attention to himself. Sheldon is jailed and a lynch mob is gathering. But faithful Rinty is free, so there is hope...eleven more chapters up the road. Chapter Three may have serialdom's strangest title...&quot;The Cross-Eyed Goony.&quot; Don't ask. \n\nSYNOPSIS:- Rin Tin Tn - The Law of the Wild (1934) Theatrical Serial..\nJohn Sheldon is falsely accused by Frank Nolan of killing Lou Salters. With his owner now in prison, Nolan steals Sheldon's horse Rex with plans to ride him in a big race. Sheldon's dog, Rinty, Alice Ingram and her sidekick Henry rescue Rex and Alice rides him in the race instead. The winnings from the race are used to pay for Sheldon's defense.\n\nRex, a wild stallion, and Rinty, a police dog, are pals. Their master , John Sheldon, is framed for murder, and Alice Ingram plans to race Rex for money to pay for John's legal defense. Meantime, Frank Nolan, who has falsely accused John, sets out to steal Rex for himself. \n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4999 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English\nRunTime 225 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 225 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0be429b60fcb3cec765ffd9f85a33b2bf8969f4a","amp;dn":"Rin+Tin+Tin+-+Law+of+the+Wild+%281934%29+DVD9+-+Disk+3+-Western+Seri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0be429b60fcb3cec765ffd9f85a33b2bf8969f4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,228,41,182,15,203,60,236,118,95,253,159,133,163,59,43,248,150,159,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
