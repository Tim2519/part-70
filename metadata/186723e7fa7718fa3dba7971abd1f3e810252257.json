This band was named after the Italian composer, Vincenzo Bellini (1801Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1835).\n\nBellini is a rhythmic, tight, beautifully aggressive quartet consisting of Agostino Tilotta, his wife Giovanna Cacciola (both also of Italy's famed Uzeda), bassist Matthew Taylor (the Romulans) and drummer Alexis Fleisig (Girls Against Boys). Though retaining some of the basic elements of their former selves, Bellini are more focused, more structured and more rhythmic than ever before. They embody the true spirit of perseverance and punk rock, making uncompromising, honest music strictly for the brutal love of it.\n\nThis album features Damon Che, the genius drummer from Don Caballero\n\nmp3's @ 256k","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:186723e7fa7718fa3dba7971abd1f3e810252257","amp;dn":"Bellini+-+Snowing+Sun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"186723e7fa7718fa3dba7971abd1f3e810252257","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,103,35,231,250,119,24,250,61,186,121,113,171,209,243,232,16,37,34,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
