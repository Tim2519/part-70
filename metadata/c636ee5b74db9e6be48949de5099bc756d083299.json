If anything, the higher profile he's received as part of the Raconteurs has offered Benson the opportunity to ratchet up his perfectionism and indulge in a bit of retro fantasia, allowing him to pair the bright neo-Motown of &quot;Garbage Day&quot; with &quot;Gonowhere,&quot; a rather brilliant pastiche of prime Wings. All the extra time and budget on My Old, Familiar Friend does result in a record where it's easier to admire Benson's reach but it's at a cost: the extra care does take a good deal of the power out of his power pop, putting his music somewhat at a remove even when it's at its liveliest, as on the opener &quot;Eyes on the Horizon&quot; or the cheerful, not entirely ironic, breakup stomp &quot;Don't Wanna Talk.&quot; Such is the trade-off of working on a grander scale -- ambitions are realized at the expense of energy. Fortunately for Benson, even if he doesn't quite have the vocal presence to fully inhabit this stage, his taste and melodic skills are suited for this bigger scale so My Old, Familiar Friend winds up as an effective showcase for his craftsmanship even if it never quite grabs ahold the way Lapalco did.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c636ee5b74db9e6be48949de5099bc756d083299","amp;dn":"Brendan+Benson+-+My+Old%2C+Familiar+Friend+%5B2009%5D%5BEAC.LOG.cue.FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c636ee5b74db9e6be48949de5099bc756d083299","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,54,238,91,116,219,158,107,228,137,73,222,80,153,188,117,109,8,50,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
