In the tradition of Michael Moore's documentary (Capitalism: A Love Story) Stock Shock reveals the down and dirty schemes behind the glitter of Wall Street. Sirius XM stock seemed poised to go through the roof. Then something went horribly wrong. Investors saw their stock drop to 5 cents/share in 2009. Was it bad management, a poor economy...or stock market manipulation? Stock Shock is a must see for anyone who has ever lost money in stocks...or fears they're about to.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca26c0bda4ff28cb755a0ccac463c3573e8e519f","amp;dn":"%5B2009%5D+Stock+Shock.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca26c0bda4ff28cb755a0ccac463c3573e8e519f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,38,192,189,164,255,40,203,117,90,12,202,196,99,195,87,62,142,81,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
