Barrett (Author)\nHardcover: 464 pages\nPublisher: Yale University Press; First Edition edition (September 2002)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0300091966\nISBN-13: 978-0300091960\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description\nPublication Date: September, 2002\nLivia (58 BC-29 AD), the wife of the first Roman emperor, Caesar Augustus, and mother of the second, Tiberius, wielded power at the centre of Roman politics for most of her long life. Livia has been portrayed as a cunning and sinister schemer, but in this biography (the first in English devoted to her) Livia emerges as a much more complex individual. Achieving influence unprecedented for a woman, she won support and even affection from her contemporaries and was widely revered after her death. Anthony A. Barrett, author of acclaimed biographies of Caligula and Agrippina, here examines Livia's life and her role in Roman politics. He recounts the events of her life, from her early days as a member of the wealthy and powerful Claudian family through her final conflicts with the new Emperor Tiberius. Barrett also considers how Livia helped shape the pattern of Roman government that prevailed for the next four centuries.\n\n===================================================================================\nEditorial Review\nFrom Library Journal\nBarrett, who has written biographies of Caligula and Agrippina, here reconstructs the life of a noteworthy Roman historical figure about whom little direct information is available. Livia maintained a &quot;deliberate reserve&quot; throughout her life and was steadfastly committed to being the Emperor Augustus's wife. Much has been suggested about the influence she had on her husband during his tenure, and common belief holds that she deliberately poisoned his successors. Barrett counters the mostly negative attacks on her character, arguing that much of what has been said about her is spurious. As such, those responsible for documenting the imperial family, such as the historian Tacitus, get scrutinized. Barrett explores other facets of Livia's personality, such as her interest in horticulture and political patronage. The book presents the general politics of the time and highlights other key figures from imperial Rome. Surprisingly, Livia was highly regarded by the Roman Senate, as well as by other peers, who often commended her for her generosity. Barrett's work is probably denser and more detailed than would interest the average reader, but for those keenly interested in studying ancient Rome it comes as a welcome addition to the genre.

Now he adds an excellent biography of Livia-as appealing to the general reader as it is satisfying to the scholar.&quot; -Colin M.
