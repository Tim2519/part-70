Dermot Mulroney of THE GREY and ZODIAC stars as an ex-con just released from prison, kicked out of his trailer home, and gone on a cross-country journey to his long-lost brother's pony ranch. But along the way, he'll encounter a depraved American underbelly of dusty towns, bizarre strangers, sudden violence, and a device that can record dreams onto VHS. Lindsay Pulsipher (''Justified'', ''True Blood'') and Natasha Lyonne (AMERICAN PIE) co-star in this surreal Sundance sensation about shadowy pasts, questionable futures, and the deadpan traveling man known only as THE RAMBLER.\n\nBROUGHT TO YOU BY CLOWNSEC * HONK *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab8374dea927ddbafc11838e9bb09371e17f3b85","amp;dn":"The+Rambler+%282013%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+CLOWNSEC+%28PhreakyFlix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab8374dea927ddbafc11838e9bb09371e17f3b85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,131,116,222,169,39,221,186,252,17,131,142,155,176,147,113,225,127,59,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
