Essentially it's just Rik and Ade doing what they do best... beating the shit out of each other for our amusement. \nIt also boasts memorable stints by Jennifer Saunders, Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. \nThe sketches were filmed in 1986, long before BOTTOM came along. This download also includes an original sketch performed on a show called BOOM BOOM OUT GO THE LIGHTS back in 1981, shortly before THE YOUNG ONES came along.\n\nPlease probe my increasingly popular IMDb list:\nBEST BRITISH COMEDY SERIES': My Top 100 Pom-Coms   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/list/tk9Ev4e6mBY/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/list/tk9Ev4e6mBY/&lt;/a&gt;\n*I'm very proud of it because it's received over 100,000 views.
