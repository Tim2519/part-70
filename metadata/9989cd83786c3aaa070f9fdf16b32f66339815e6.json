Martin P. Keerns. (2013)\n\n Greetings my fellow truth seeker. My name is Martin Keerns, I have passionately researched, compiled, and edited the following series of books for you with much love, care, and dedication over the last 5 years. - Thousands of hours of demanding work went into what you are about to read. \n\n I take great pleasure in finally being able to present to you this the first section of my work: - Hopefully this will have been for your benefit first of all, but perhaps also just a little bit for your pleasure. (As you will discover if you read this, I have quite a wicked and very dry sense of humour). \n\n These first four books when taken together make up just one small part of a meganormously extensive four part series of work that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve dubbed the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grand Unified Theory SeriesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nThis initial section has been titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Notice of IntentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (This is for a number of reasons that will become abundantly clear to anyone who does bother to read it all the way through).\n\n This section deals with a whole range of issues, ALL concerning one thing in particular - CONTROL.\n\n Part One - Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sex, Drugs, Rock and KontrolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ The first book looks at social control, being enforced through mind control, largely for the purpose of population control. I also lay out hundreds of pages of very hard hitting no-punches-pulled information, (including some quite rare or Ã¢â‚¬Å“hard to come byÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ articles) on a subject that REALLY rips my knitting more than anything else. - Organised paedophilia.\n\n Part Two - Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dumbed down word controlled monkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s who think that keeping up with the JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and not being the stupidest guy or gal in the room is ALL that really mattersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ concentrates on the multi-faceted and ubiquitous methods of mind control that are routinely being used on entire populations by our wanabee owners to train, manipulate, condition, and herd, (yet at the same time alienate us from each other) every single day of our lives from the womb to the cold dark tomb. \n\n Part Three - Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Needle and the Damage DoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ this third part of the section quite literally bulges to the point of bursting trying to contain all of the crucial facts detailing all the different Ã¢â‚¬Å“weaponsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that are being utilised by the small group of rich, influential psychoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (who we allow to be in charge) who collectively are doing EVERYTHING they can to limit our numbers using population control. \n\n Part Four - To end the first section we have Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Random Collection of Conspiracy Facts for One to Theorise OnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which demonstrates the truly endemic nature of all this control that I have been highlighting in the previous three works. There are subjects that could have been included in the earlier parts but that ultimately didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it solely because I tried to maintain Ã¢â‚¬Å“themesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the earlier books. - But that has absolutely no bearing on their quality, (in fact my first chapter on the moon landings, in my own honest, humble, and modest opinion, nails this subject better than any other individual has done on their own before me). The second half of the book also seriously examines, in great detail, money, banking, and world finance in general for some 500 odd pages. \n I saw which way the wind was blowing before I ever started this project, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve known right from day one that it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be too long a period of time before our would be owners would find ways to limit our access to the treasure trove of information that is Ã¢â‚¬Å“the netÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Blocking sites, disappearing sites (articles and books), subscription only access to newspaper archives - these have all proven my hunch to be right. That is why all of my books contain hundreds of these articles in their entirety. They also contain loads of diagrams, charts, graphs, pictures, and the original documents that I cite. \n\n This was always intended to be a comprehensive reference work from its inception (which is why the books are each on average something like 900 pages long). This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a quick concise opinion or two: \n This is truly a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grand Unified TheoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nEnjoy, and please do make an effort to share. Much Love to you all. Your good friend Martin Keerns.\n\n Part Three: The Needle and the Damage Done.\n\n Introduction (also the dark side of the loon) - Pages 1 to 9 - I wrote this introduction bored and frustrated, I was at a bit of low ebb during my 5 years that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve just spent doing this writing malarkey actually, (and also while not having a fucking clue where I was going to be living within weeks of when I wrote it) - itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever so slightly raw. Contents - Pages 11 to 12 \n\n Chapter 32 - Pages 14 to 80 Eugenics - The true sport of KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s - A few rudimentary facts about why you and I have to die (ESPECIALLY IF ELDERLY). Plus: At the end of the chapter IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll tell you what a Keechyerpantscoaster is!\n\n Chapter 33 - Pages 82 to 150 Population Control is what itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all been about (The last three books) - And as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see for yourself: The bastard child of Eugenics is more organised than an obsessive compulsiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sock drawer.\n\n Chapter 34 - Pages 152 to 170 An inconvenient truth (Real this time too) - The facts concerning world population from the people who want you dead. - Birth rates are actually diving! Plus: LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all move to Texas.\n\n Chapter 35 - Pages 172 to 225 GAVI and the Good Club - No it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t SeventyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funk band, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually one of the most evil and heinous bunch of murdering bastardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on the planet. - (Well, apart from their REAL bosses that is (DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get to these guyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and galÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s during Section 2 - which begins after just one more book of section one, (which follows this one that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re reading now.)))\n\n Chapter 36 (Part One) - Pages 227 to 339 I will prove to you using graphs from the British and American GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s National OfficeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of Statistics (other governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too) showing you, without ANY shadow of doubt, that vaccination does not work! - And they make totally provable 100% false claims that they 100% know they have no fucking right too! - I will then also furnish you with quite recently released documentation, presented in a scientific report, proving that the UK government KNOWS that they kill and maim yet they will lie to us ALL about this. (Sometimes even I Love the Freedom of Information Act - The shredder must have been on the blink that week).\n\n Chapter 36 (Part Two) - Pages 82 to 150 The remarkable health of children who do not take any vaccines. - YOU WILL BE RATHER STUNNED, THEN (if you have a brain) VERY ANGRY!\n\n Chapter 37 - Pages 367 to 462 A SELECTION BOX OF FluÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s - Swine, Bird, Spanish, Deadly, and of course - Deadly Manmade!\n\n Chapter 38 - Pages 464 to 536 To begin with, a rather long chronological list of medical professionalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deliberately harming the public, (just in order to demonstrate to you that they have absolutely no problem in doing so). Plus: A selection of vaccine ingredientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that will totally shock you. Thimerosal. And then to finish this chapter off a frightening BBC Ã¢â‚¬Å“PanoramaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ documentary transcript on mercury.\n\n Chapter 39 (Part One) - Pages 538 to 575 This Fluoride Trilogy starts with the stuff being put in the water supply, and some dental and nuclear facts that may get you angry. - Oh wait minute. No they wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t - (See Part 2)\n\n Chapter 39 (Part Two) - Pages 577 to 601 The Lunatic drug - The NaziÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and CommunistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (What the fuck was the actual difference between them, apart from better tailoring and better choices in facial hair?) They both put it in the water to keep prisoners of War or Concentration camp workers docile; apparently it makes you lose all of your will to resist authority. - Handy if we were ever in a dictatorship.\n\n Chapter 39 Part (Three) - Pages 603 to 631 And if you just thought it was in your tap water, or toothpaste, your miles wide of the mark - itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in nearly every fucking thing that we eat or drink when we go to the supermarket!\n\n Chapter 40 - Pages 633 to 686 Artificial SweetenerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular sweetener started life as a chemical weapon! It melts the brains of ratÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s monkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and humanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s - and THOSE FACTÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S ARE ALL MOSTLY FROM THE ACTUAL TESTS THAT GOT THIS SHIT APPROVED FOR OUR CONSUMPTION! - For my dear Mother Liz. X\n\n Chapter 41 - (Part One) Pages 688 to 748 This Chapter is also for Liz, and Andy McD. (Nay kiss for you Specky!) - Cancer, our present understanding, and the hard and honest facts about its Ã¢â‚¬Å“treatmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“survivalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rates.\n\n Chapter 41 - (Part Two) Pages 750 to 824 An alternative theory on what cancer actually is - the expertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a clue - Based on the work of a man who had a 100% successful cure for it over 70 years ago! He also knew what it was, how to kill it (without harming the patient), and he even had time to build the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most brilliant microscopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. - Nobel Prize? Nope, drove to ruin, and his existence is virtually a myth, his work is now ridiculed even though he was in top science magazines, and he only dealt with men at the very top of medicine, in every field. (And they reckoned he was a genius) (And he done this for about ten yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s) itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a scandalous yet 100% true tale!\n\n Chapter 41 - (Part Three) Pages 826 to 895 The main thing you really need to beat cancer is HOPE... and hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as much as I could find. - Some REAL cureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that (mostly) donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cost anything. (Read the nocebo article thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in the next chapter once you finish this chapter too please) (I just didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to end two chapterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the same way in case you thought IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d got vaccine induced AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, or had too much fluoride, or too much Aspartame, or maybe just too many jointÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, sorry. (- I done it anyway, I put it in both just to save my wee mum reading the whole AIDS chapter for one article.)\n Chapter 42 - Pages 897 to 1040 I think Cancer and AIDS are different conditions of the same ailment. (In more ways than one) - But mainly for this one reason more than any other: - DEATH BY AZT! - For Leon.\n\n Chapter 43 - Pages 1042 to 1111 Epilogue to part three - Requiem in Social, Physical, and Medical, Mind Kontrol. - This is my summation of all that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve (hopefully) learned during this extremely long-winded, and at times rather insane sounding, Ã¢â‚¬Å“weeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ trilogy of mine. I sincerely and honestly feel that by the time you get to this point I will have accomplished the goal of this part of my work. - You should be an individual who totally understands the subject of population control (enough to educate others on this matter), and you will have ALL the proof needed in order to do so.
