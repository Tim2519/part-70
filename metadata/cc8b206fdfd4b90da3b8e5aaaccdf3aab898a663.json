Oops, I mean this Christmas season. Megyn started out discussing the ethnicity of Santa Clause, by saying Ã¢â‚¬Å“And by the way for you kids at home, Santa just IS white.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Really, Megyn, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bother reassuring the kids in the audience. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re on Fox NewsÃ¢â‚¬â€thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nobody under the age of 70 in the audience. Megyn told kids that someone was Ã¢â‚¬Å“just arguing that maybe we should also have a black Santa.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Oh thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatÃ¢â‚¬â€separate but equal Santas! I think you just threatened children with some kind of unholy apartheid Christmas. But things got out of hand when Megyn pronounced that Jesus was white as well! Was Jesus Ã¢â‚¬Å“whiteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½? It depends upon how liberal you are with your definition of white. And IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m guessing that the audience for Fox News isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t willing to stretch it. Jesus was a Middle-Eastern man and a Jew. He probably looked more like Mohammed Atta than he looked like either of the guys in ABBA.\n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re learning a lot more about that fake interpreter of sign language for the deaf at the Mandela memorial. And no, we are not learning it from his signing. As near as people who actually understand sign language can ascertain the closest he came to making sense is when he seems to have told the runner on first to steal second on the next pitch.\n\nThe interpreter says he is being treated for schizophrenia and saw angels while he was onstage. So if you were worried that a total fraud was allowed onstage next to world leaders, relax. He wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a fraud, exactlyÃ¢â‚¬â€heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mentally ill. The man was inches away from the President of the United States! If Barack wants to spend any time with the mentally ill, he will invite the Tea Party Congressional caucus to the White House.\n\nFinally, this new budget deal is simply horrendous. The key to compromise is that both parties should be unhappy. They both shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be absolutely miserable. In fairness, the conservative opponents of this budget deal would be miserable with any agreement that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t immediately end Obamacare, Medicare, and Social Security. Yes, this deal keeps the government open... open long enough for them to loot it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc8b206fdfd4b90da3b8e5aaaccdf3aab898a663","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+December+12+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc8b206fdfd4b90da3b8e5aaaccdf3aab898a663","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,139,32,111,223,212,185,13,163,184,229,170,172,205,243,170,184,152,166,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
