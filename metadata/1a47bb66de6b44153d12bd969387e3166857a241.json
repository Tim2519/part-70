Authoress Anna Wulf attempts to overcome writers block by writing a comprehensive golden notebook which draws together the preoccupations of her life, each of which is examined in a different notebook: sources of her creative inspiration in a black book, communism in a red book, the breakdown of her marriage in a yellow book, and day-to-day emotions and dreams in a black book.\n\nAnnas struggle to unify the various strands of her life - emotional, political and professional amasses into a fascinating encyclopaedia of the female experience in the 50s. In this authentic, taboo-breaking novel Lessing brings the plight of womens lives, from obscurity behind closed doors, into broad daylight. A true modern classic which has been meaningful and resonant to a great many women, The Golden Notebook is deserved of its reputation as a feminist bible. A notoriously long and complex work, it is given a new life by this - its first unabridged recording.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a47bb66de6b44153d12bd969387e3166857a241","amp;dn":"The+Golden+Notebook+-+Doris+Lessing+%282010+-+Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a47bb66de6b44153d12bd969387e3166857a241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,71,187,102,222,107,68,21,61,18,189,150,147,135,227,22,104,87,162,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
