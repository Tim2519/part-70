Wake up Churches of America.\n \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Scripture Mysteries Series - Parts 1 thru 6:\n\nThe Forgotten Dream\nOur new collection &quot;Scripture Mysteries&quot; is a documentary series that seeks to discover the truth behind a number of Biblical subjects. Our first film in the series is, &quot;The Forgotten Dream.&quot; This DVD delves into a couple of serious questions. The firs t question being, &quot;Are there rea lly any good reasons to believe in the Bible?&quot; and secondly, &quot;What does the future hold?&quot; We have traveled far and near to find archaeologists, and theologians who can help shed light on these questions.\n\nThe Most Incredible Prophecy\nIt has been noted that up to 30 percent of the Bible is prophecy. Throughout the Old Testament there are over 300 specific prophecies that reveal life and character of the Messiah. He would have to pass the prophetic test by fulfilling every Messianic prophecy. Furthermore, there is a prophecy in Daniel 9 that gave the Messiah a short time frame in which to fulfill most of these prophecies. Did Jesus pass the test? In this episode we travel around to archeologist, and scholars to find answers to one of the most important subjects in history.\n\nTheodicy\nFor centuries the question has been asked, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If God is so good why is there so much suffering in the world?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Why has sin and evil lasted so long? What does the Antichrist have to do with all of this? Is God ever going to d o something about pain and suffering? In this documentary we are on a search for answers to these questions. Along the way we will look into the history of evil. Join us for an exciting journey into one of the most perplexing subjects known to man, the question of Theodicy.\n\nThe Ark Of The Covenant\nWhat ever happened to the ark of the covenant? What made this golden box so holy that any one who touched it died? Does the law have any relevance in the time that we live? Why is the Antichrist interested in the contents of this golden box? What is the New Covenant spoken of by the prophet Jeremiah? In this film we search for answers to these questions and others that surround the ark of the covenant and the ten commandments.\n\nThe Antichrist Power Revealed\nThe Scriptures speak of a power referred to as the little horn, the beast, or the antichrist power. We will begin by going back to the great prophecy of Daniel chapter seven which foretold the future with incredible clarity. Then through connection with Revelation  we dig deeper to find more clues as to the identity of this power. Through this we discover twelve characteristics including where the antichrist power arises from. After carefully looking over each Biblical point you will discover for yourself who this power is.\n\nThe Overcoming Seminar:\nIn this seminar we look into the fundamentals of bad habits and how to overcome them. How are habits formed, and how can they be changed? Many struggle with a variety of habits ranging from anger, lack of forgiveness, lust, addictions to substances, repetitive unhealthy thoughts and a host of other vices. In this seminar we look at scientific, health, and biblical principles that aid in the victory over habits. This is presented by Chad and Fadia Kreuzer. Chad and Fadia share seminars on health, the Bible, and overcoming habits, they have taught in Europe and throughout North America.\nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, to Bless all that Seed Long.\n\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH.
