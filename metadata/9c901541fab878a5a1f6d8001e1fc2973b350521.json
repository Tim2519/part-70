And you know what Republicans will sayÃ¢â‚¬â€he only did it to distract attention from the problems with the Obamacare website. Well, except for Lindsey Graham. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to be saying that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about Benghazi.\n\nOther Republican pundits immediately denounced the deal reached with Iran as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“capitulationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Obama. To Republicans, everything President Obama does internationally is either a surrender or an apology. If Obama took John McCainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advice and Ã¢â‚¬Å“bomb bomb bombed IranÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ then conservative pundits would call it Ã¢â‚¬Å“appeasement.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nRush Limbaugh is comparing filibuster reform to rape. Rush painted a world that he made up with a group of six men and four women who have Ã¢â‚¬Å“a rule that the men cannot rape the women.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Then some of the men want to change the rule. Evidently every society has somebody like Rush Limbaugh in it.\n\nSarah Palin says that God Ã¢â‚¬Å“blessedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ her with a platform on Fox News to defend herself from criticism. Sarah, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not God, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rupert Murdoch. But then I know that a lot of conservatives confuse the two.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to take up the question of whether or not corporations have religious rights. How can something have religious rights when they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have morals or ethics? Hobby Lobby refuses to provide insurance coverage for contraceptives as mandated by the new health law because they say that violates their religious freedom. Under that logic, an employer who is a Christian Scientist shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to provide any healthcare coverage at all.\n\nIn a great conversation with Bill Moyers, author Henry Giroux says that modern politics is turning people into zombies. The world of politics is not a good place for a zombie to be. Zombies want to eat brains, and there arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a lot of those in politics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c901541fab878a5a1f6d8001e1fc2973b350521","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+November+25+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c901541fab878a5a1f6d8001e1fc2973b350521","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,144,21,65,250,184,120,165,161,246,216,0,30,31,194,151,59,53,5,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
