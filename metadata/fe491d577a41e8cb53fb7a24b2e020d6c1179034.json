This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nCarole King sings her way into the top forty for the first time in nine years. Casey calls her the most successful singer/songwriter in the business.\n\nThere are two songs with the phrase &quot;power to the people&quot; in the title; one by the Plastic Ono Band (at number 31) and another by the Chi-Lites (at number 28).\n\nThe highest debuting song in the top 40 is &quot;Rainy Days And Mondays&quot; by The Carpenters (at number 20). This is only its second week in the hot 100.\n\nOne group in the countdown was home on break when the youngest member phoned a radio station to say thanks for playing his new solo record. When they didn't believe it was him, he got his big brother to call the station and prove it was him.\n\n40: Nathan Jones - The Supremes\n39: Another Day - Paul McCartney\n38: It's Too Late - Carole King\n37: I Don't Know How To Love Him - Yvonne Elliman\n36: Booty Butt - Ray Charles Orchestra\n35: Me And My Arrow - Nilsson\n34: The Drum - Bobby Sherman\n33: Cool-Aid - Paul Humphrey &amp; The Cool-Aid Chemists\nSPECIAL: Travelin' Man - Rick Nelson\n32: We Can Work It Out - Stevie Wonder\n31: Power To The People - Plastic Ono Band\n30: Reach Out, I'll Be There - Diana Ross\n29: Don't Knock My Love - Wilson Pickett\n28: (For God's Sake) Give More Power To The People - Chi-Lites\nSPECIAL: You Got To Move - The Rolling Stones\n27: I'll Meet You Halfway - The Partridge Family\n26: It Was Right On The Tip Of My Tongue - Brenda &amp; The Tabulations\n25: Toast And Marmalade For Tea - Tin Tin\n24: Treat Her Like A Lady - Cornelius Brothers &amp; Sister Rose\nSPECIAL: When A Man Loves A Woman - Percy Sledge\n23: Woodstock - Matthew's Southern Comfort\n22: I Don't Blame You At All - Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles\n21: I Love You For All Seasons - Fuzz\n20: Rainy Days And Mondays - The Carpenters\n19: Timothy - The Buoys\n18: What's Going On - Marvin Gaye\n17: I Don't Know How To Love Him - Helen Reddy\n16: Here Comes The Sun - Richie Havens\n15: Superstar - Murray Head w/ The Trinidad Singers\n14: I Am I Said - Neil Diamond\n13: Sweet And Innocent - Donny Osmond\n12: Stay Awhile - The Bells\n11: Love Her Madly - The Doors\n10: Chick-A-Boom - Daddy Dewdrop\n9: If - Bread\nSPECIAL: Money - Barrett Strong\n8: It Don't Come Easy - Ringo Starr\n7: Bridge Over Troubled Waters - Aretha Franklin\n6: Want-Ads - Honeycomb\n5: Me And You And A Dog Named Boo - Lobo\n4: Put Your Hand In The Hand - Ocean\n3: Brown Suger - The Rolling Stones\n2: Never Can Say Goodbye - The Jackson Five\n1: Joy To The World - Three Dog Night","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe491d577a41e8cb53fb7a24b2e020d6c1179034","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1971_May_22nd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe491d577a41e8cb53fb7a24b2e020d6c1179034","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,73,29,87,122,65,232,203,83,251,122,36,178,224,32,214,193,23,144,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
