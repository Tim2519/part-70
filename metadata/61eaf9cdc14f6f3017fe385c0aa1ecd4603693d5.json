In the first round, the competitors have a lot of work to do, including breaking down an uncommon protein and figuring out how to make coffee a key part of their appetizers. Then in the entree round, a grain and a green must make it onto the plate. And when the last two moms find themselves facing off in the dessert round, they must make nutty and fruity flavors work together.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 07-May-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61eaf9cdc14f6f3017fe385c0aa1ecd4603693d5","amp;dn":"Chopped.S15E05.MOMumental.HDTV.XviD-pwe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61eaf9cdc14f6f3017fe385c0aa1ecd4603693d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,234,249,205,193,79,111,48,23,254,56,92,10,161,236,212,96,54,147,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
