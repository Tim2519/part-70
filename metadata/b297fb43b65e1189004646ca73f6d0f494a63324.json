They are told that the &quot;KJV&quot; is antiquated, hard to understand, and inaccurate. Modern versions of the Bible, on the other hand, are translations of manuscripts that have been transmitted in a secular form throughout history, tainted by unbelieving narcissistic scholarship as early as the days Paul began penning Holy Scripture under the inspiration of God. (2 Corinthians 2:17)\n\n In this collection of videos many great Bible believers (Bryan Denlinger, Dr Gipp, Dr Grady, Dr Ruckman, Dr Stauffer, David Daniels, Greg Miller etc.) share their knowledge and strengthen our faith and the assurance in the unblemished perfect words of God, the absolute and final authority of the Holy King James Bible.\n\n Belief in the perfect authority of the KJB, preserved by God throughout history, enables us to speak GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s truth to anyone at any time without being dishonest. (Matthew 7:28-29) It is a sad fact that many pastors and Christians call their Bible Ã¢â‚¬Å“GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wordÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and yet in their heart they do not believe that it is without error. (1 John 5:10-13)\n\n True Bible believers do not teach that the KJB is an Ã¢â‚¬Å“accurate translationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or that it Ã¢â‚¬Å“contains the  message of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, but that the text of the King James Bible itself, are the actual written words of God to the English speaking world. (Psalms 12:6-7)\n\n The King James Bible stands as a testament to the power and saving grace of our Heavenly Father. A glimmer of glory amidst paradise lost. The calm center amidst a storm of lies. No other religious book (including the original autographs) has ever come close to producing the spiritual fruit (Luke 6:43-44) that the King James Bible has produced in less than 400 years. There have been over 200 new bible perVersions produced since 1881 to replace the KJB. All of them have failed! \n &quot;Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.&quot;\n\n There are other videos included as well: \n -Diaprax, which is the method of destroying absolute final authority through dialogue and praxis used in the school system.\n -Positions of Schools, is showing what kind of positions of schools there are and how they might deceive you into applying if you want to go to a good Bible college.\n -Also a couple of well made documentaries and presentations\n\n Learn about the history of the Bible, the value of the KJB, and the problems of academic seduction surrounding modern Christian scholarship, and arm yourself with the pure, trustworthy words of God.\n\n One of the most significant failings of the Church today is a lack of final authority in Scripture. Anyone who is willing to correct the Bible is willing to put himself above the authority of the Bible. Every Christian should learn about this issue and understand that the Bible, not a man, is the final authority by which all matters of faith and practice must be judged. This is impossible when you do not believe the book in your hands is the pure, perfectly preserved words of God!&quot;\n\n For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven\n FOREVER! FOREVER! FOREVER! KJB 1611\n\n\n\n\n You can find and support the speakers through the Links.mhtml file.\n\n Loads of thanks to Apuebla (from ConspiracyHub) for helping me to create this collection and to JesusFreak (POtHS series) for giving access to his seed server.\n And praise and glory to the Lord Jesus Christ for his sacrifice for our salvation and to God for His perfectly preserved words, the final absolute authority we can trust, the Holy Bible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b297fb43b65e1189004646ca73f6d0f494a63324","amp;dn":"Bible+Believers%27+Defense+of+the+Perfect+King+James+Bible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b297fb43b65e1189004646ca73f6d0f494a63324","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,151,251,67,182,94,17,137,0,70,70,202,115,246,208,244,148,166,51,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
