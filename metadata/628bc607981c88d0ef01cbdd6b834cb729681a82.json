Struggling to survive, clinging on to love and meaning wherever it can be found. Think 28 DAYS LATER meets THE ROAD.\n\nGenre: Science Fiction\n\n\n\nDark inside: Since mankind began, civilizations have always fallen: the Romans, the Greeks, the Aztecs. Now it's our turn. Huge earthquakes rock the world. Cities are destroyed. But something even more awful is happening. An ancient evil has been unleashed, turning everday people into hunters, killers, crazies.\n\nMason's mother is dying after a terrible car accident. As he endures a last vigil at her hospital bed, his school is bombed and razed to the ground, and everyone he knows is killed. Aries survives an earthquake aftershock on a bus, and thinks the worst is over when a mysterious stranger pulls her out of the wreckage, but she's about to discover a world changed forever. Clementine, the only survivor of an emergency town hall meeting that descends into murderous chaos, is on the run from savage strangers who used to be her friends and neighbors. And Michael witnesses a brutal road rage incident that is made much worse by the arrival of the police--who gun down the guilty party and then turn on the bystanding crowd.\n\nWhere do you go for justice when even the lawmakers have turned bad? These four teens are on the same road in a world gone mad. Struggling to survive, clinging on to love and meaning wherever it can be found, this is a journey into the heart of darkness - but also a journey to find each other and a place of safety.\n\nRage Within: Aries, Clementine, Michael, and Mason have survived the first wave of the apocalypse that wiped out most of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s population and turned many of the rest into murderous Baggers. Now theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re hiding out in an abandoned house in Vancouver with a ragtag group of fellow teen survivors, trying to figure out their next move.\n\nAries is trying to lead, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to be a leader when there are no easy answers and every move feels wrong. Clementine is desperate to find her brother Heath, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impossible to know where heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be, assuming heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s alive. Michael is haunted by the memories of his actions during his harrowing struggle to survive. And Mason is struggling with something far worse: the fear that he may be a danger to his friends.\n\nAs the Baggers begin to create a new world order, these four teens will have to trust and rely on each other in order to survive.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:628bc607981c88d0ef01cbdd6b834cb729681a82","amp;dn":"Dark+Inside+series+by+Jeyn+Roberts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"628bc607981c88d0ef01cbdd6b834cb729681a82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,139,198,7,152,28,136,208,239,1,203,221,107,131,76,183,41,104,26,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
