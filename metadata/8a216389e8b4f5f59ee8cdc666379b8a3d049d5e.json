Two years later, while singing on stage with The Carpenters at the Santa Barbara County Bowl, she stopped the show so that she could pull up her knee socks and got a huge laugh from the sold out crowd. Kathleen claims &quot;it was then I knew I had to be a performer.&quot; She began by writing songs that sounded like the ones she was supposed to be practicing to on the piano. She was in every school theater production, and when she wasn't writing or acting, she was listening to her brother's AC/DC and Eagles records, or her father's Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald albums. Kathleen eventually became the youngest member of the Santa Barbara Songwriters Guild.\n\nAfter high school, Kathleen had a choice to make: would she pursue drama or music? She enrolled in the USC Drama School, and two months later had landed her first movie role. As her acting career began to blossom, so did her enthusiasm as a songwriter. She made a few demos, and a short while later landed a deal with Mercury Records. Unfortunately, her record deal came right before a &quot;house cleaning.&quot; Her A &amp; R person was fired and Kathleen was dropped. Disappointed and a bit confused, she packed her bags and moved to Europe, then to Austin, Texas where she found herself surrounded by &quot;crystal-meth addicts.&quot;..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a216389e8b4f5f59ee8cdc666379b8a3d049d5e","amp;dn":"Kathleen+Wilhoite+-+Shiva+%5B2000%5D%5BEAC.Log%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a216389e8b4f5f59ee8cdc666379b8a3d049d5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,33,99,137,232,180,245,245,158,232,205,198,102,55,155,138,61,4,157,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
