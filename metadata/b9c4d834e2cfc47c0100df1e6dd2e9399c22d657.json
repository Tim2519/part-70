All he wants is a home of his own and to be left in peace. But Major Bourdain refuses to respect his wishes. Jonah is a healer and once saved Bourdain's life. Now Bourdain thinks Jonah can help him live forever -- and he intends to do whatever it takes to capture him and use his gifts. Equally determined not to be caught, Jonah seeks refuge in the small-town home of Luce Andahar, a diner waitress with some dark secrets of her own. While he's there, he's almost able to believe that his dream can come true -- that he and Luce can make a life together. Then the dream becomes a nightmare as Bourdain closes in.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/s/sharon-sala/healer.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/s/sharon-sala/healer.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9c4d834e2cfc47c0100df1e6dd2e9399c22d657","amp;dn":"Sharon+Sala+-+The+Healer+%28mobi%2Cepub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9c4d834e2cfc47c0100df1e6dd2e9399c22d657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,196,216,52,226,207,196,124,1,0,223,30,109,210,233,57,156,34,214,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
