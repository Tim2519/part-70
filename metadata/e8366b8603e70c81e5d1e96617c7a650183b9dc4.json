Messner\n\nI've always liked this album. Other reviewers went into great detail describing the content, so I won't go into specifics. All I'll say is that this is one of the most beautifully haunting collections of music that I've ever heard. Since the death of Layne Staley, I've been listening to this cd even more often than I used to. It feels even more special now; it is truly AIC's greatest gift to music, in my opinion. I can listen to these seven songs over and over and over, and they always lead to a more reflective state of mind and a trance-like feeling that's unique to this album. It's really difficult to put into words, but if you appreciate the uniqueness of this album even half as much as I do, you'll never part with it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8366b8603e70c81e5d1e96617c7a650183b9dc4","amp;dn":"Alice+in+Chains+-+Jar+of+Flies+-+FLAC+%28Big+Papi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8366b8603e70c81e5d1e96617c7a650183b9dc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,54,107,134,3,231,12,129,229,209,233,102,23,199,166,80,24,59,157,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
