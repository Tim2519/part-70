Staley \n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nWith increased attention paid to diversity, the application of skills to future careers, and even more relatable research, the third edition of FOCUS ON COLLEGE SUCCESS recognizes the varied experiences of today's students and guides them to be more motivated and focused. The research-based approach builds a solid foundation allowing students see the relevancy of this course to their lives. By helping students develop realistic expectations of what it takes to learn, FOCUS motivates and encourages students with direct applications and immediate results. Written by Constance Staley, one of the best-known names in the field of motivation, this text increases the credibility of the college success course by providing tools that help students succeed and thereby improve institutional retention rates. Starting with the use of the FOCUS Challenge Cases that introduce each chapter, FOCUS ON COLLEGE SUCCESS strikes a personal and informal conversation with readers--directly connecting with them and drawing them into text discussions. In a recent survey of students using FOCUS, 97 % would recommend that their professor use this book again with next year's first year students. Many students today are over-optionalized and over-obligated. FOCUS ON COLLEGE SUCCESS addresses those issues head-on, creating teachable moments--and concrete results--in every class period.\n\nISBN-13: 978-0-534-63865-8\nISBN-10: 0-534-63865-1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d22dc869bd1194fc2fd2b24ef9b58238fb8632cc","amp;dn":"Staley_FOCUS_on_College_Success.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d22dc869bd1194fc2fd2b24ef9b58238fb8632cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,45,200,105,189,17,148,252,47,210,178,78,249,181,130,56,251,134,50,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
