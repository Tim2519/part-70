It came in a dream April 15th, 2007.\n\n &quot; In my dream I was flying above the tree tops and looking down at a major highway below that was empty. For as far as I could see cars were parked on the grass beside the highway and people were standing out beside their cars with the doors open. A message told me they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it up the road, that they were waiting for something that would help them. At this point I began to sing this song as if it were on a loud speaker. Over the past few months, the journey that this song has taken us all on is proof that the words and melody seem to hold a subtle embedded message that only the heart can hear. What a privilege it is to be able to deliver it. &quot; C.Hutton\n\n These are the wonderful artists, sound and energy healers who donated their time and loving energy to help bring this message to you today: Ann-Marie Boudreau, Barb Gale, Dennis Gaumond, Eva-Marie Hannah, Trent Hutton, Edward Majkut, Val Smith, Lisa Spillane, Cheryl Storey, Gina TomÃƒÂ© and Anita Turner. \n\n01.

Originally, the band consisted of the core member: David Wolfe (drums), Dave Steinberg (guitar and vocals), and Tony Thorpe (bass and vocals). Jackie Ayala (vocals) joined the band in August 2001. Bill Greene (keyboards) joined in May 2002. Don't bother with any of our other songs, they suck, and our food is too expensive, we only cater to the rich.
