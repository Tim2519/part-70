THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS is at least in conception a standard ASTOUNDING problem-solving story (interstellar matter transmitter is sabotaged; Earth and alien ports are in danger, resourceful engineer-protagonist figures out the solution) with a standard STARTLING STORIES subplot (engineer and his pretty female assistant are deeply attracted but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too dedicated to his job to get fresh). The premise however is ingenious--alien cultures intervene and as a result of this Earth is given the means for interstellar trade before the planet has even achieved space travel. Teleportation as an instrument of routine commerce (and profit) was a fairly original concept at the time this story was published. Del ReyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s altered culture is lived-in, letting the story act as a letter from the future. Gold wanted the story significantly cut and del Rey of course complied; in THE EARLY DEL REY he used the original version and appended some notes on the nature of HoraceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intervention.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b61b8d6f8ed6bd9cfbb5ac717526b2bbf8fd7ce","amp;dn":"The+Wind+Between+the+Worlds+-+Lester+Del+Rey.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b61b8d6f8ed6bd9cfbb5ac717526b2bbf8fd7ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,97,184,214,248,237,107,217,207,187,90,199,23,82,107,43,191,143,215,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
