The screenplay by Benn Levy and Tom Reed is based on the 1930 play of the same title by Robert E. Sherwood.\n\nThe film was remade twice, under its original title in 1940 and as Gaby in 1956. Both remakes were made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which bought the 1931 version from Universal. \n\nToday, the rights to all three films are held by Warner Bros. and their subsidiary Turner Entertainment.\n\nBecause of its controversial material, censor boards in Chicago, New York City, and Pennsylvania insisted extensive cuts be made to the film. When the Production Code was enforced in July 1934, it became impossible to re-release the original version of Waterloo Bridge.\n\nIn 1939, MGM bought the rights to the property, and the following year released an adaptation starring Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor and directed by Mervyn LeRoy. The 1956 film Gaby, directed by Curtis Bernhardt and starring Leslie Caron and John Kerr, advanced the story's timeline to World War II.\n\nAfter being stored in the studio vaults for thirty-five years, Waterloo Bridge was re-discovered in 1975, but a joint ownership agreement between MGM and Universal prevented it from being seen for another two decades.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Mae Clarke as Myra Deauville\n    Douglass Montgomery as Roy Cronin\n    Doris Lloyd as Kitty\n    Frederick Kerr as Major Fred Wetherby\n    Enid Bennett as Mrs Mary Cronin Wetherby\n    Bette Davis as Janet Cronin\n    Ethel Griffies as Mrs Hobley, Landlady\n\n    Directed by James Whale\n    Produced by Carl Laemmle, Jr.\n    Written by Benn Levy, Tom Reed\n    Based on the play by Robert E.

She meets her clients on Waterloo Bridge, the primary entry point into the city for soldiers on leave. During an air raid, she meets fellow American Roy Cronin, a member of the Canadian Army, and he joins Myra in her apartment.\n\nDescribing herself simply as an unemployed chorus girl, Myra gains Roy's sympathy, and he offers to pay her overdue rent. After she rejects his offer and he departs, Myra returns to the streets. The following morning, Roy returns to visit her, and landlady Mrs. Hobley lets him into her apartment. There he meets Myra's friend and neighbor Kitty, who tells him Myra needs someone to love and protect her. Myra later berates Kitty for interfering and rejects her advice to marry Roy to ensure a better future for herself.\n\nRoy brings Myra to visit his mother Mary and sister Janet at their country estate, where he proposes to Myra, who later that night tells Mary the truth about herself. Mary is sympathetic but implores Myra not to marry Roy. The following morning, Myra slips away and returns to London by train. Eventually Roy visits her and asks her to explain her abrupt departure. \n\nBecause he is on the verge of returning to the battlefields in France, he begs Myra to marry him immediately. She agrees, but escapes from her apartment through a window while he waits for her in the hallway. Seeking the rent, Mrs. Hobley enters and, believing Myra has run off to avoid her financial obligation, reveals her true profession to Roy.\n\nAlthough shocked, Roy searches for Myra and eventually finds her on Waterloo Bridge, where he tells her he still loves and wants to marry her. The military police insist Roy join a truck of departing soldiers or be considered a deserter, and once he secures Myra's promises to marry him upon his return, he departs. The air raid sirens sound, and as Myra seeks shelter, she is killed by a bomb.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 1:21:00\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 1:21:0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:238cc99128006398027265a3102b1c047485f6a0","amp;dn":"Forbidden+Holywood+Collection+Vol.+1+-+Disk+1+-+Xvid+1cd-+Waterl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"238cc99128006398027265a3102b1c047485f6a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,140,201,145,40,0,99,152,2,114,101,163,16,43,28,4,116,133,246,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
