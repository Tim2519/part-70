Ten years later, still unable to let go of his grief, Hugo began participating in hundreds of sÃƒÂ©ances to reestablish contact with her. In the process, he claimed to have communed with the likes of Plato, Galileo, Shakespeare, Dante, Jesus--and even the Devil himself. Hugo's transcriptions of these conversations have all been published. Or so it is believed...\n\nOne set of conversations was hidden by Hugo himself and has remained hidden for more than 160 years.\n\nRecovering from her own losses, mythologist Jac L'Etoile arrives on the Isle of Jersey--where Hugo conducted the sÃƒÂ©ances--hoping to uncover a secret about the island's Celtic myths. But the man who invited her there, a troubled soul named Theo Gaspard, hopes she'll help him discover something quite different--Hugo's lost long conversations with someone called the Shadow of the Sepulcher.\n\nFrom one of America's most gifted and imaginative storytellers, Seduction- Suspense Magazine's 2013 BOOK OF THE YEAR - is an intricately plotted and atmospheric novel with a spellbinding ghost story at its heart.\n\n**\n\nFrom Booklist\n\nJac LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Etoile, the mythologist and television host who starred in The Book of Lost Fragrances (2012), returns in a book that is pretty much the same as that one. Like Fragrances, this novel involves a lost item from history (here itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a supposedly lost transcription of a conversation the French author Victor Hugo had, during a sÃƒÂ©ance, with someone from beyond the grave). It also, like its predecessor, involves a present-day mystery linked to the historical item (in this case, a manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife died in a manner much the same as that of Victor HugoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter, whose death spurred him to try sÃƒÂ©ances in the first place). But does the fact that the two books are very similar mean this one is bad? Not at all. What sells the bookÃ¢â‚¬â€what sells all of RoseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s booksÃ¢â‚¬â€is not the characters or the plots; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boundless enthusiasm for the material. She believes passionately in her characters and their stories, and we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help getting caught up in that enthusiasm. We care about Jac, despite her being not particularly well drawn (sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more a series of brushstrokes than a real person), because Rose cares about her so deeply; we care about what happens to Jac when she travels to the British island of Jersey and discovers sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been lured there under false (and mysterious) pretenses, because Rose does. RoseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s growing fan base will probably devour this one. --David Pitt\n\nReview\n\n&quot;Everything a thriller fan could wish for: reincarnation, spiritualism, Druids, Jungian psychology, even perfumery... one of the marvels of the book is how well it all hangs together.&quot;(Philly.com/The Inquirer)\n\n&quot;Rose seduces the reader from the very first page.
