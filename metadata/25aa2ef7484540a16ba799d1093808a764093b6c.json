Titus's men strap Miles down to the cart and begin the process of draining his blood. Rachel appears and rescues Miles. They escape back to Willoughby, taking Titus's wife, Jessica, with them. The war tribe advances on the town, but Miles threatens to kill TitusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ wife if they attack. A warrior, previously seen working for the Patriots, tries to get Titus to back down from attacking but Titus resists. In the house, Jessica, Titus's wife begs Rachel not to give her back to Titus, because she's afraid of him. Miles offers himself to Titus in exchange for the safety of the town residents. Titus agrees, but also sends in a spy to check on his wife. The spy and Rachel discover she killed herself so she won't have to return to Titus. As the last wagon out of town is leaving, Titus discovers the deception, and his tribe begins to brutally attack the town. Meanwhile, in the Savannah Refugee Camp, Tom Neville tells Jason they are now Patriots, working for the U.S. Government, until they &quot;climb to the top and kill them all.&quot; He burns his wife's picture. Upon returning to their tent at the end of the day, they are attacked and beaten unconscious. After waking, they are questioned by the Patriots. The group reveals they know NevilleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true identity. He talks his way into release after Allenford intervenes, but Jason will not be let go. In the Plains Nation, Adam and Charlie catch up to their wagon only to be ambushed by Monroe who knocks out Adam. Monroe reveals to Charlie that Rachel is wanted by the Patriots for crimes against the U.S. Government. Back at Willoughby, the town is saved when the Patriots, wielding assault rifles, kill all the attackers. Meanwhile, Titus is next to his dead wife and cries over his wife's body. But then, one of the tribe members throws a bag over his head, capturing him. Meanwhile, Miles sees the Patriots marching into the town, killing all the tribesmen, and setting up an American flag, taking control of the town. Rachel lies critically injured from an arrow, but was helped by the Patriots.  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25aa2ef7484540a16ba799d1093808a764093b6c","amp;dn":"Revolution.2012.S02E03.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25aa2ef7484540a16ba799d1093808a764093b6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,170,46,247,72,69,64,161,107,167,153,209,9,56,8,167,100,9,59,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
