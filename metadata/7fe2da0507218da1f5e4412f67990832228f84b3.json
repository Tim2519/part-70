How his alter-ego copes (or fails to cope) with the new and often appalling responsibilities of a lone doctor in a vast country practice Ã¢â‚¬â€ on the eve of Revolution Ã¢â‚¬â€ is described in Bulgakov's delightful blend of candid realism and imaginative exuberance.\n\nIn 2012, the book was turned into a television miniseries, called &quot;A Young Doctor's Notebook&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fe2da0507218da1f5e4412f67990832228f84b3","amp;dn":"A+Country+Doctor%27s+Notebook+-+Mikhail+Bulgakov+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fe2da0507218da1f5e4412f67990832228f84b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,226,218,5,7,33,141,161,245,228,65,47,103,153,8,50,34,143,132,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
