Ã¢â‚¬â€œ specifically Pseudolus, Miles Gloriosus and Mostellaria Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it tells the bawdy story of a slave named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door.\n\nThe film was directed by Richard Lester, with Zero Mostel and Jack Gilford reprising their stage roles. It also features Buster Keaton in his last motion picture role, Phil Silvers, and Lester favorites Michael Crawford, Michael Hordern and Roy Kinnear.\n\nThe musical was adapted for the screen by Melvin Frank and Michael Pertwee from the stage musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart. They rearranged the plot and cut most of the songs. The movie was not well received when first released, and, although it did turn a profit, the creators of the musical have frequently expressed their dissatisfaction with it.\n\nCast\n\nZero Mostel as Pseudolus\nPhil Silvers as Marcus Lycus\nMichael Crawford as Hero\nJack Gilford as Hysterium\nAnnette Andre as Philia\nBuster Keaton as Erronius\nMichael Hordern as Senex\nLeon Greene as Captain Miles Gloriosus\nPatricia Jessel as Domina\nInga Neilsen as Gymnasia\nPeter Butterworth as Roman Sentry\nRoy Kinnear as Gladiator Instructor\nPamela Brown as High Priestess\nBeatrix Lehmann as Domina's Mother\nBill Kerr as Gladiator-in-Training\nJon Pertwee as Crassus\nFrank Thornton as slave driver\nIngrid Pitt as Courtesan\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:529c1f5a53c3c67142223aa857ca72f820290d1e","amp;dn":"A+Funny+Thing+Happened+on+the++the+Forum+%5BiPhone%5D+1966","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"529c1f5a53c3c67142223aa857ca72f820290d1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,156,31,90,83,195,198,113,66,34,58,168,87,202,114,248,32,41,13,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
