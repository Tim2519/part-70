Each individual evening was marked by a unique theme with different set lists, arrangements and ensembles providing the viewer with four unique performances. His journey begins in the intimate setting of the 200-capacity London Borderline with a three-piece band. The result is a jammy tribute to Bonamassa's earlier career, with songs he hasn't played live in years. Next is a blues-themed night at Shepherd's Bush Empire, featuring a horns section to create a soulful, big-blues-band feel. He then moves to the Hammersmith Apollo which opens with a short acoustic set before moving into a rock-inspired evening. Finally, at the Royal Albert Hall, Bonamassa treats the crowd to a half acoustic/half electric show of his most popular and well known songs, featuring the acoustic band from his most recent release, An Acoustic Evening at the Vienna Opera House. Each night's performance features a different selection of songs - over 60 in total and some having never been performed live before - from his extensive career beginning with 2000's A New Day Yesterday. The end result more than lives up to its billing as &quot;The Guitar Event of The Year&quot; and sees Bonamassa reliving, revisiting and redefining the many phases and pivotal moments throughout his career over the course of four evenings. It goes without saying that the challenge was daunting, but Bonamassa more than picked up the gauntlet after it was thrown down and delivers a once-in-a-lifetime performance that more than serves as an appropriate career retrospective for an artist who has already achieved so much.\n\nDate: 27 March , 2013\nQuality: BD Remux\nFormat: MKV\nVideo: AVC, &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b5fddcd2ddf5f9819b84&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;, 16:9 (1920x1080p), 25999 kbps, 23,976 fps\nAudio 1: LPCM, 2 ch, 2304 kbps, 24-bit, 48 kHz\nAudio 2: AC-3, 6 ch, 448 Kbps, 16-bit, 48 kHz\nAudio 3: DTS MA / Core, 6 ch, 4225 kbps/1509 kbps, 24-bit, 48 kHz\nSubtitles: English\nChapters: Yes\nDuration: 1:46:57\n\nMembers:\nJoe Bonamassa (vocal, guitars)\nCarmine Rojas (bass)\nTal Bergman (drums)\nAlan Schierbaum (keyboards)\nLee Thornburg (trumpet)\nSean Freeman (sax)\nMike Feltham (trombone)\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
