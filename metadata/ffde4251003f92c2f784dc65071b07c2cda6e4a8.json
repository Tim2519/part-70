Kelley\nI can't say enough positive things about this CD. I have only purchased it last year and it has immediately become my new favorite Christmas album! The orchestra really brings to life more traditional holiday favorites while introducing some new songs that are DESTINED to become family classics. This album gets played from start to finish and then started right up again during the holidays! I also don't think you need to see the Christmas Spectacular to appreciate it. It's upbeat jingles and medleys will have you tapping your toes in your living room--though I will admit, after having seen the musical in person, my love of the CD skyrocketed becuase I now had a jolly Christmas image to associate with the tunes. Plus this CD is very reasonably priced for the kind of listening you'll get out of it--truly one of my favorite holiday compilations! Big time, Big Band, Merry Merry Christmas!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffde4251003f92c2f784dc65071b07c2cda6e4a8","amp;dn":"Rockettes+-+Radio+City+Christmas+Spectacular+320cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffde4251003f92c2f784dc65071b07c2cda6e4a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,222,66,81,0,63,146,194,247,132,220,101,7,27,7,194,205,166,228,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
