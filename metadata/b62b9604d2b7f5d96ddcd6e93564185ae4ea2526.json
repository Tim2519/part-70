Whoever did these files made them much larger in the 300 MB range.\nThat's why I didn't grab that many of these. It's up to you guys to keep this torrent alive or go over to Hulu to watch them instead. That's free too!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b62b9604d2b7f5d96ddcd6e93564185ae4ea2526","amp;dn":"The+IMPROV+--+Robert+Conrad%2C+Richard+Belzer%2C+Jeff+Cesario","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b62b9604d2b7f5d96ddcd6e93564185ae4ea2526","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,43,150,4,210,183,245,217,109,220,214,233,53,100,24,90,228,234,37,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
