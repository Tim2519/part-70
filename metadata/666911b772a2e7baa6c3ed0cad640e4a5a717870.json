Twenty miles from the crash site, Deborah Sanborn has a vision of two survivors, cold, hurting and scared. Over the years she has learned to trust her gift, and she senses these strangers are in terrible danger. She sees a hunter, moving in for the kill.\n\nFour generations of O'Ryan men have gathered at the crash site, ready to search for the missing boy, Johnny O'Ryan. His forty-five-year-old grandfather Mike O'Ryan isn't sure what to make of Deborah, but with the snow coming down, sh's all they've got to lead them through the mountains. Because not only are they racing against time and the elements...they're up against a killer desperate to silence his only living witnesses to murder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:666911b772a2e7baa6c3ed0cad640e4a5a717870","amp;dn":"Dinah+McCall+-+The+Survivors+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"666911b772a2e7baa6c3ed0cad640e4a5a717870","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,105,17,183,114,162,231,186,166,195,237,12,173,100,14,74,90,113,120,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
