In 1961, the first issue of FANTASTIC FOUR was drawn and written by the brilliant team of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee, and set a new standard for heroic adventure comics. Few people realize that the Fantastic Four Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a family of sci-fi adventurers gifted with amazing powers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was actually based on the lives of real people. As often is the case, real life was as astonishing as fiction. UNSTABLE MOLECULES is a biography that revisits the Fantastic Four's beginnings with a historian's eye.\n\nWriter: James Sturm\nPenciller: Guy Davis\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff981507d03289d0d369970dd801d63fee83d60e","amp;dn":"FANTASTIC+FOUR+-+UNSTABLE+MOLECULES+01-04+%282003%29+Requested","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff981507d03289d0d369970dd801d63fee83d60e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,152,21,7,208,50,137,208,211,105,151,13,216,1,214,63,238,131,214,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
