Was it his commitment to honesty and his unfailing integrity? Was it his courage to stand up against the injustices of his day? Was it his ability to lead the American people through the perils of war and unify the country through the conviction of his ideals?\n\nIn Leadership Lessons of Abraham Lincoln, the best, most thought-provoking, and inspiring excerpts from LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s speeches and writings have been collected in an effort to help todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s business leaders apply his principles to their own work and life. While it may not always be easy to follow Honest AbeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sterling example, the lessons one learns from reading this book are sure to inspire and give rise to some deep contemplation about the role of the leader in organizations both small and large, and reaffirm oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s faith in the principles Lincoln held so deeply.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e01705b5d92c9770607e4e00f8ffac22f58fa0cc","amp;dn":"Leadership+Lessons+of+Abraham+Lincoln.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e01705b5d92c9770607e4e00f8ffac22f58fa0cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,23,5,181,217,44,151,112,96,126,78,0,248,255,172,34,245,143,160,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
