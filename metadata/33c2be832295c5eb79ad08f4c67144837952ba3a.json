But no one seems to believe him. The next day, his father investigates the site - and returns, acting very strangely. Next it's his mother, then his teacher, then a classmate - all programmed, zombie-like, with strange scratches on their necks. David's last chance is to get to the Marine base and alert them - before a vital secret mission is sabotaged, before the Martians take over the plant Earth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33c2be832295c5eb79ad08f4c67144837952ba3a","amp;dn":"Invaders+From+Mars+-+Ray+Garton.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33c2be832295c5eb79ad08f4c67144837952ba3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,194,190,131,34,149,197,235,121,173,8,244,198,113,68,131,121,82,186,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
