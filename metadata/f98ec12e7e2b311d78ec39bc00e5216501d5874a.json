Every year, I make a series of Christmas music videos for my church, and I'm trying to round out the line up. I'm kind of thinking that your knowledge of Christian music surpasses my own (which is no small feat, if I do say so myself), so I'm coming to you (or anyone else reading this) for assistance. I need a song. I'm replacing Glory to God by Todd Agnew. It's a very energetic song performed by a gospel choir, and it's supposed to be the angels singing to the shepherds. I need something along the same lines. Can anyone out there help me? It would be very appreciated.\n\nIf anyone is interested in seeing any of my lyric videos, do a user search for PaleoPirate on YouTube. I've got 20 or so videos uploaded so far, with more on the way. \n\n----\n\n...As I am unable to think of any songs for PaleoPirate right off the top of my head, I was hoping that maybe some of you might.  So thanks in advance guys.\n\nINSTRUMENTAL: 12 Stones.
