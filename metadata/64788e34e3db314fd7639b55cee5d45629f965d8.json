I admit, upon ripping open the wrapping paper, I was a little worried that I had opened a gift for my mother, but this CD has made me a genuine Celine fan. (And thanks toI have the CD collection to prove it!) Some of my favorite tracks are perfect for the whole year 'round, including &quot;Another Year Has Gone By,&quot; which talks about love enduring and growing throughout every season, &quot;Don't Save It All For Christmas Day,&quot; which Celine co-wrote, &quot;The Prayer,&quot; with Andrea Bocelli, which brings tears to my eyes after only a few lines, and, of course, &quot;I'm Your Angel,&quot; with R. Kelly, which spent six weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100! My favorite track, though, &quot;These Are The Special Times,&quot; was played at my graduation last June. Simply beautiful. Diane Warren and Celine are a match made in musical Heaven. So, even though the holidays are a good month away, get in the mood with this awesome CD! And once January rolls around, you won't be able to put it away. Hey, &quot;don't save it all for christmas day!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64788e34e3db314fd7639b55cee5d45629f965d8","amp;dn":"C%26eacute%3Bline+Dion+-+These+Are+Special+Times+-+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64788e34e3db314fd7639b55cee5d45629f965d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,120,142,52,227,219,49,79,215,99,155,85,206,229,212,86,41,249,101,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
