Starting with Ptolemy, Ã¯Â¿Â½father of modern geography,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and ending with satellite cartography, A History of the World in 12 Maps brings maps from classical Greece, Renaissance Europe, and the Islamic and Buddhist worlds to life and reveals their influence on how weÃ¢â‚¬â€literallyÃ¢â‚¬â€look at our present world.\n\nAs Brotton shows, the long road to our present geographical reality was rife with controversy, manipulation, and special interests trumping science. Through the centuries maps have been wielded to promote any number of imperial, religious, and economic agendas, and have represented the idiosyncratic and uneasy fusion of science and subjectivity. Brotton also conjures the worlds that produced these notable works of cartography and tells the stories of those who created, used, and misused them for their own ends.\n\nabout author :-\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sed.qmul.ac.uk/english/staff/Profiles/images/item89643.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sed.qmul.ac.uk/english/staff/Profiles/images/item89643.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFollowing a state education in Leeds, I studied for a BA (Hons) in English at Sussex University, followed by an MA at Essex University in the Sociology of Literature. I lived in East Berlin before returning to study for a PhD in early modern mapping under Lisa Jardine at Queen Mary. After appointments at Leeds University and Royal Holloway, I returned to Queen Mary in 2003, and was appointed Professor of Renaissance Studies in 2007. My first book, Trading Territories: Mapping the Early Modern World (1997) began an interest in mapping and east-west cultural exchange. This was followed by collaborative work with Lisa Jardine that led to Global Interests: Renaissance Art between East and West (2000). I have since written The Renaissance Bazaar: From the Silk Road to Michelangelo (2002), The Sale of the Late KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Goods (2006), The Renaissance: A Very Short Introduction (2006), and A History of the World in Twelve Maps (2012). My books have been translated into fourteen languages and I am a regular broadcaster, critic and feature writer, presenting BBC4Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s three-part TV series, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMaps: Power, Plunder and PossessionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (2010), BBC NI's 'Mapping Ulster' (2013), BBC Radio 3Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœCourting the EastÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (2007), and co-curating as well as editing the catalogue of Ã¢â‚¬ËœPenelopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Labour: Weaving Words and ImagesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, an exhibition at the Venice Biennale of 2011.\n\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf3dd07347da7b7816932196de38992e05cc43f1","amp;dn":"a+history+of+the+world+in+12+maps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf3dd07347da7b7816932196de38992e05cc43f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,61,208,115,71,218,123,120,22,147,33,150,222,56,153,46,5,204,67,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
