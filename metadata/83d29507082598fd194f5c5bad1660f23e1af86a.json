Frustrated by her kissably-challenged lifestyle, Arielle allows herself to be talked into selling her first kiss to the highest bidderÃ¢â‚¬â€on eBay. The media soon catches wind of her story and all of a sudden sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s giving interviews and appearing on popular late-night talk shows. Due to her newfound fame, the former wallflower suddenly finds herself the focus of everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention, including that of the most popular guy at school, an actor who just happens to be the teen heartthrob of the moment and even the local bad boy. But as her popularity grows and her friendships begin to weaken, Arielle starts to wonder why she put up the post in the first place. In the end there will be a winner, but will ArielleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first kiss end up being everything sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever dreamed of?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83d29507082598fd194f5c5bad1660f23e1af86a","amp;dn":"Kiss+%26amp%3B+Sell+-+Brittany+Geragotelis.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83d29507082598fd194f5c5bad1660f23e1af86a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,210,149,7,8,37,152,253,25,79,92,91,173,22,96,242,62,26,248,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
