Team (JOHN O'FLYNN, DAVID BRANDES, FELIX GAUDER &amp; DOMENICO LABARILLE) and published by Toshiba-EMI's Intercord Japan (i-DANCE) label. This rare album was only released in Japan and has over the years become VERY expensive to obtain and own. Remastered and completly restored.\n\n-Originally the vocals for Missing Heart was Lyane Leigh (1994-1999) but after she left she was replaced by Lydia Madajewski (1999-2002). All the songs on the album are sung by Lydia except &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot; which is the original version by Lyane Leigh.\n\n- Ã£Æ’â€°Ã£â€šÂ¤Ã£Æ’â€žÃ£ï¿½Â®BROSÃ£ï¿½Â«Ã£â€šË†Ã£ï¿½Â£Ã£ï¿½Â¦Ã§â€Å¸Ã¦Ë†ï¿½Ã¦Â¬Â Ã¨ï¿½Â½Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã¨â€¡â€œÃ£ï¿½â€¹Ã£â€šâ€°Ã£ï¿½Â®Ã¥â€Â¯Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã£ï¿½Â®Ã£â€šÂ¢Ã£Æ’Â«Ã£Æ’ï¿½Ã£Æ’Â Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦ï¿½Â±Ã¨Å ï¿½EMIÃ£ï¿½Â®IntercordÃ¦â€”Â¥Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã£ï¿½Å’Ã§â„¢ÂºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã£Æ’ï¿½Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£Æ’Â Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã£â€šÂ¸Ã£Æ’Â§Ã£Æ’Â³O'FLYNNÃ£â‚¬ï¿½DAVIDÃ£Æ’â€“Ã£Æ’Â©Ã£Æ’Â³Ã£Æ’â€¡Ã£â€šÂ¹Ã£â‚¬ï¿½FELIX GAUDERÃ¯Â¼â€ DOMENICO LABARILLEÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã£ï¿½Â¨Ã¯Â¼Ë†I-DANCEÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã£Æ’Â©Ã£Æ’â„¢Ã£Æ’Â«Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ£ï¿½â€œÃ£ï¿½Â®Ã£ï¿½Â¾Ã£â€šÅ’Ã£ï¿½ÂªÃ£â€šÂ¢Ã£Æ’Â«Ã£Æ’ï¿½Ã£Æ’Â Ã£ï¿½Â¯Ã¦â€”Â¥Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã£ï¿½Â§Ã£ï¿½Â®Ã£ï¿½Â¿Ã£Æ’ÂªÃ£Æ’ÂªÃ£Æ’Â¼Ã£â€šÂ¹Ã£ï¿½â€¢Ã£â€šÅ’Ã£â‚¬ï¿½Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã©â€“â€œÃ£ï¿½Â§Ã¥ï¿½â€“Ã¥Â¾â€”Ã£ï¿½â€”Ã£â‚¬ï¿½Ã¦â€°â‚¬Ã¦Å“â€°Ã£ï¿½â„¢Ã£â€šâ€¹Ã£ï¿½â€œÃ£ï¿½Â¨Ã£ï¿½Â¯Ã©ï¿½Å¾Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã£ï¿½Â«Ã©Â«ËœÃ¤Â¾Â¡Ã£ï¿½Â«Ã£ï¿½ÂªÃ£ï¿½Â£Ã£ï¿½Â¦Ã£ï¿½â€žÃ£ï¿½Â¾Ã£ï¿½â„¢Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ£Æ’ÂªÃ£Æ’Å¾Ã£â€šÂ¹Ã£â€šÂ¿Ã£Æ’Â¼completlyÃ¥Â¾Â©Ã¥â€¦Æ’Ã£â‚¬â€š - Ã£â€šâ€šÃ£ï¿½Â¨Ã£â€šâ€šÃ£ï¿½Â¨Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã¨â€¡â€œÃ£ï¿½Å’Ã¨Â¦â€¹Ã£ï¿½Â¤Ã£ï¿½â€¹Ã£â€šâ€°Ã£ï¿½ÂªÃ£ï¿½â€žÃ£ï¿½Å¸Ã£â€šï¿½Ã£ï¿½Â®Ã£Æ’Å“Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£â€šÂ«Ã£Æ’Â«Ã£ï¿½Â¯LyaneÃ£Æ’ÂªÃ£Æ’Â¼Ã¯Â¼Ë†1994Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã£ï¿½â€¹Ã£â€šâ€°1999Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£ï¿½Â§Ã£ï¿½â€šÃ£ï¿½Â£Ã£ï¿½Å¸Ã£ï¿½Å’Ã£â‚¬ï¿½Ã¥Â½Â¼Ã¥Â¥Â³Ã£ï¿½Å’Ã¥Å½Â»Ã£ï¿½Â£Ã£ï¿½Å¸Ã¥Â¾Å’Ã£â‚¬ï¿½Ã¥Â½Â¼Ã¥Â¥Â³Ã£ï¿½Â¯Ã£â‚¬ï¿½Ã£Æ’ÂªÃ£Æ’â€¡Ã£â€šÂ£Ã£â€šÂ¢MadajewskiÃ¯Â¼Ë†1999Ã£ï¿½â€¹Ã£â€šâ€°2002Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£ï¿½Â«Ã§Â½Â®Ã£ï¿½ï¿½Ã¦ï¿½â€ºÃ£ï¿½Ë†Ã£â€šâ€°Ã£â€šÅ’Ã£ï¿½Â¾Ã£ï¿½â€”Ã£ï¿½Å¸Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ£â€šÂ¢Ã£Æ’Â«Ã£Æ’ï¿½Ã£Æ’Â Ã£ï¿½Â®Ã£ï¿½â„¢Ã£ï¿½Â¹Ã£ï¿½Â¦Ã£ï¿½Â®Ã¦â€ºÂ²Ã£â€šâ€™LyaneÃ£Æ’ÂªÃ£Æ’Â¼Ã£ï¿½Â«Ã£â€šË†Ã£â€šâ€¹Ã£â€šÂªÃ£Æ’ÂªÃ£â€šÂ¸Ã£Æ’Å Ã£Æ’Â«Ã§â€°Ë†Ã£ï¿½Â§Ã£ï¿½â€šÃ£â€šâ€¹Ã£â‚¬Å’Ã£Æ’Â Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£Æ’Â³Ã£Æ’Â©Ã£â€šÂ¤Ã£Æ’Ë†Ã£â€šÂ·Ã£Æ’Â£Ã£Æ’â€°Ã£â€šÂ¦&quot;Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥Â¤â€“Ã£ï¿½Â®Ã£Æ’ÂªÃ£Æ’â€¡Ã£â€šÂ£Ã£â€šÂ¢Ã£ï¿½Å’Ã¦Â­Å’Ã£ï¿½â€ Ã£ï¿½â€¢Ã£â€šÅ’Ã£ï¿½Â¦Ã£ï¿½â€žÃ£ï¿½Â¾Ã£ï¿½â„¢Ã£â‚¬â€š\n\nTracklist\n\n1.
