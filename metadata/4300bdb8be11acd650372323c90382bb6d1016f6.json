Love Won't Last the Afternoon \n\n\n\nDavid Poe is a songwriter, singer, producer, performing musician and composer for film, theater and dance.\n\nTransplanted to New York City from the American Midwest, Poe served as the sound engineer at CBGB's Gallery before he was signed to Sony Music. He has released five studio albums to date: David Poe (Sony/550) produced by T-Bone Burnett, The Late Album (Sony/Epic), Love Is Red (Universal/The Lab) a live album, David Poe Live &amp; Solo (The Artists Den) a live performance DVD for PBS, David Poe Onstage at the World CafÃƒÂ© (Universal/Decca) and two commissioned works for dance: The Copier: Music for Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet and the much-heralded Shadowland: Music for Pilobolus.\n\nSolo and with his band, David Poe has toured the world many times over. He has served as support act for Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Tori Amos, The Jayhawks, Chris Whitley and numerous others. He's also produced recordings by Regina Spektor, Kraig Jarret Johnson, John Ã¢â‚¬Å“ScrapperÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sneider, Joseph Arthur and Jesse Harris and written songs with several artists, including Grace Potter, Reni Lane, T-Bone Burnett, Larry Goldings and Duncan Sheik.\n\n&quot;David Poe gives the singer-songwriter genre a much-needed jolt,&quot; wrote Rolling Stone of his award-winning debut. In the UK, the London independent likened his songs to &quot;miniature novels,&quot; NME called him &quot;a sophisticated city breed&quot; and in Europe Rolling Stone awarded Poe's second effort a coveted four-star review.\n\nWith unusual arrangements and intricate lyrics, songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re The Bomb,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Late Song (Je Ne Suis Pas Mort)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ may not have been the stuff of corporate radio, but Poe managed to create a loyal following around the world through touring, alternative radio and by licensing his songs for films and television like Transamerica, The OC, Dawson's Creek and Jesus Henry Christ. In 2005, Harp magazine called Love Is Red &quot;the make-out record of the year,&quot; Poe picked up the award for Best New Artist from the National Critics Poll in Germany, and Time Out! New York called him &quot;the perfect man,&quot; making it much easier for him to meet women.\n\nIn 2009, Poe was named a composer fellow by the Sundance Institute. His film scores to date include Dare, an official selection of the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, The Brooklyn Heist, a broad comedy, Harvest, a family drama, and Little Spirit, an animated holiday special for NBC, the latter two both collaboration with Sheik.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4300bdb8be11acd650372323c90382bb6d1016f6","amp;dn":"David+Poe+-+Love+is+Red+%5B2005%5D%5BEAC%2CLOG%2CCUE%2CFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4300bdb8be11acd650372323c90382bb6d1016f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,0,189,184,190,17,172,214,80,55,35,35,201,3,130,187,109,16,22,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
