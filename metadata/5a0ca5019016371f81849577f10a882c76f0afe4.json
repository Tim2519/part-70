It was produced by Leon Clore, sponsored by Ford for its Look at Britain series, filmed by the usual Free Cinema technical staff - in particular cinematographer Walter Lassally and editor John Fletcher - and delivered in the same 50-minute format.\n\nThe film once again took a sympathetic approach to an aspect of working-class life largely neglected by commercial British cinema. After Every Day's dignified depiction of market workers in Covent Garden, Lambeth Boys attempted to deliver a positive portrait of the lives of ordinary teenagers, far from the usual violent 'Teddy Boy' stereotype. In a sense, the film also developed the theme initiated by Reisz and Tony Richardson in Momma Don't Allow three years earlier.\n\nLambeth Boys was shot over six weeks in the summer of 1958 in and around the Alford House, a youth club in the Oval area of South London. It follows a group of teenagers at work, at home and in their leisure time, giving them space to express their frustrations and aspirations.. The film is never so good as when it lets the camera move around the group or capture their faces in close-up, rather than providing facts and figures or a sociological analysis.\n\nLanguage\tEnglish\nSubtitles\tincluded: English (MKV file) and Portuguese-Br (srt)\n\nGeneral\nContainer:  \tMatroska\nRuntime: \t50mn 38s\nSize: \t        3.41 GiB\n\t\nVideo\nCodec: \t        x264\nResolution: \t956x720 \nAspect ratio:  \t4:3\nFrame rate: \t23.976 fps\nBit rate: \t9 127 Kbps\nBPP: \t        0.553\n\t\nAudio#1:  \tEnglish 2.0ch AC-3 @ 320 Kbps\n\nFrom KG, by Scottathon.
