Collins formed the musical group Nu-Sonics in 1976, which later became Orange Juice. He has since pursued a solo career as a musician, in addition to work as an illustrator, television actor and producer, and as a record producer. Collins has won an Ivor Novello Award.\n\nHis eighth solo album Understated was released in March 2013 on his own AED Records and was critically well received, with God Is In The TV stating 'Understated is more than just another step to recovery, it is indeed a fine record in its own right, and utterly life-affirming. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also perhaps the ultimate testament to the healing power of music. He lost the ability to read, write, and lost movement in half of his body, but what he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lose was his gift for coming up with an ear-catching tune, as is proved here. It will make you smile, it may even make you cry, and its an album that reminds you how good it is to be alive.' (wikipedia.org)\n\n- - -\n\nEdwyn Collins - Understated\n(Aed 2013)\n\n 1.
