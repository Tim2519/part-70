This is part three of AT40, I'm Casey and the countdown rolls on.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCasey tells us about the town of Nutbush, a town so small that it isn't on the map and doesn't have a mayor (but it has a song about it at number 38 by Ike &amp; Tina Turner).\n\nHe also tells the story of how once, when tickets for a show by Sonny and Cher went on sale, 80,000 fans tied up the phone lines from to Lake Tahoe, from the Pacific Ocean to the Missouri River trying to get seats.\n\nJim Croce has the highest debuting song of the week (&quot;Time In A Bottle&quot; at number 18). This is the first time an artist posthumously ever had two records in the top 20 at the same time.\n\nA listener writes in to inform Casey that AT40 was in an Al Pachino movie! The AT40 staff knew all about it, and Casey tells the story.\n\n\n40:    Sweet Understanding Love - The Four Tops\n39:    Ramblin' Man - Allman Brothers Band\n38:    Nutbush City Limits - Ike &amp; Tina Turner        \n37:    We May Never Pass This Way (Again) - Seals &amp; Crofts     \n36:    D'yer Mak'er - Led Zeppelin     \n35:    Half-Breed - Cher    \n34:    Be - Neil Diamond\n33:    Show And Tell - Al Wilson\n32:    Who's In The Strawberry Patch With Sally - Tony Orlando And Dawn\n31:    Why Me - Kris Kristofferson\n30:    Mind Games - John Lennon\n29:    Living For The City - Stevie Wonder    \n28:    Ooh Baby - Gilbert O' Sullivan\n27:    Knockin' On Heaven's Door - Bob Dylan\n26:    My Music - Loggins &amp; Messina\n25:    Come Get To This - Marvin Gaye\n24:    Rockin' Roll Baby - The Stylistics\n23:    All I Know - Garfunkel\n22:    The Joker - The Steve Miller Band\n21:    You're A Special Part Of Me - Diana Ross &amp; Marvin Gaye\n20:    Never, Never Gonna Give You Up - Barry White\n19:    Angie - The Rolling Stones\n18:    Time In A Bottle - Jim Croce\n17:    Let Me Serenade You - Three Dog Night\n16:    I Got A Name - Jim Croce\n15:    Cheaper To Keep Her - Johnnie Taylor\n14:    If You're Ready Come Go With Me - The Staple Singers\n13:    Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress) - Helen Reddy\n12:    Paper Roses - Marie Osmond\n11:    Hello It's Me - Todd Rundgren\n10:    The Most Beautiful Girl - Charlie Rich\n9:    Heartbeat-It's A Love Beat - The DiFranco Family\n8:    The Love I Lost (Part 1) - Harold Melvin &amp; The Blue Notes\n7:    Midnight Train To Georgia - Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips\n6:    Just You 'N' Me - Chicago\n5:    Keep On Truckin' - Eddie Kendricks\n4:    Space Race - Billy Preston\n3:    Goodbye Yellow Brick Road - Elton John\n2:    Photograph - Ringo Starr\n1:    Top Of The World - The Carpenters\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cd831005f910255dd0096867705c5d905d408b8","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1973_December_1st","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cd831005f910255dd0096867705c5d905d408b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,216,49,0,95,145,2,85,221,0,150,134,119,5,197,217,5,212,8,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
