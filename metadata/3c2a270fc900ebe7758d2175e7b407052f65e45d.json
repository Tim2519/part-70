Drawing on material little known to Western readers, and barely explored in depth in Japan itself, Hotta poses an essential question: Why did these menÃ¢â‚¬â€military men, civilian politicians, diplomats, the emperorÃ¢â‚¬â€put their country and its citizens so unnecessarily in harmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way? Introducing us to the doubters, schemers, and would-be patriots who led their nation into this conflagration, Hotta brilliantly shows us a Japan rarely glimpsedÃ¢â‚¬â€eager to avoid war but fraught with tensions with the West, blinded by reckless militarism couched in traditional notions of pride and honor, tempted by the gamblerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dream of scoring the biggest win against impossible odds and nearly escaping disaster before it finally proved inevitable.\n\nIn an intimate account of the increasingly heated debates and doomed diplomatic overtures preceding Pearl Harbor, Hotta reveals just how divided JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leaders were, right up to (and, in fact, beyond) their eleventh-hour decision to attack. We see a ruling cadre rich in regional ambition and hubris: many of the same leaders seeking to avoid war with the United States continued to adamantly advocate Asian expansionism, hoping to advance, or at least maintain, the occupation of China that began in 1931, unable to end the second Sino-Japanese War and unwilling to acknowledge WashingtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hardening disapproval of their continental incursions. Even as Japanese diplomats continued to negotiate with the Roosevelt administration, Matsuoka Yosuke, the egomaniacal foreign minister who relished paying court to both Stalin and Hitler, and his facile supporters cemented JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place in the fascist alliance with Germany and ItalyÃ¢â‚¬â€unaware (or unconcerned) that in so doing they destroyed the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bona fides with the West. \n\nWe see a dysfunctional political system in which military leaders reported to both the civilian government and the emperor, creating a structure that facilitated intrigues and stoked a jingoistic rivalry between JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s army and navy. Roles are recast and blame reexamined as Hotta analyzes the actions and motivations of the hawks and skeptics among JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite. Emperor Hirohito and General Hideki Tojo are newly appraised as we discover how the two men fumbled for a way to avoid war before finally acceding to it. \n\nHotta peels back seventy years of historical mythologizingÃ¢â‚¬â€both Japanese and WesternÃ¢â‚¬â€to expose all-too-human Japanese leaders torn by doubt in the months preceding the attack, more concerned with saving face than saving lives, finally drawn into war as much by incompetence and lack of political will as by bellicosity. An essential book for any student of the Second World War, this compelling reassessment will forever change the way we remember those days of infamy\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i43.tower.com/images/mm124254553/japan-1941-countdown-infamy-eri-hotta-hardcover-cover-art.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i43.tower.com/images/mm124254553/japan-1941-countdown-infamy-eri-hotta-hardcover-cover-art.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c2a270fc900ebe7758d2175e7b407052f65e45d","amp;dn":"Japan+1941%3A+Countdown+to+Infamy+prabhu_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c2a270fc900ebe7758d2175e7b407052f65e45d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,42,39,15,201,0,235,231,117,141,33,117,231,180,7,5,47,101,228,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
