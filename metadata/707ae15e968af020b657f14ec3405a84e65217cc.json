One of them is Arisen Flame, who makes his long-awaited debut on the ASOT label with the Universal Religion Chapter 7 approved &quot;Glarius&quot; and block-rocking &quot;Unity&quot;. On his way up with the successful Arisen Flame project since 2010, Maciej Wesek built himself quite the reputation. His tracks have always been a welcome addition to the A State of Trance show, so it's no wonder that his 'Gladius' now made it to the latest chapter of Armin van Buuren's Universal Religion. 'Gladius' is a mix of oldskool and nu trance, without repeating the classics. 'Unity' is the uplifting b-side to this must-have pack, and an anthem for all peak-time moments.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:707ae15e968af020b657f14ec3405a84e65217cc","amp;dn":"Arisen+Flame+-+Gladius+%2F+Unity+%282013%29+ASOT+-+Single+%40+320Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"707ae15e968af020b657f14ec3405a84e65217cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,122,225,94,150,138,240,32,182,87,241,78,195,64,90,132,230,82,23,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
