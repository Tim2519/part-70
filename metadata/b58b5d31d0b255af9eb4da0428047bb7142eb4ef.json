Yet few of their contemporaries could match the likes of &quot;Daydream,&quot; &quot;Summer in the City,&quot; and the transcendent &quot;Do You Believe in Magic?&quot;--a song that can still turn January into June. Legend has it that the Spoonful auditioned for The Monkees, and they'd have been good in those roles, having the right candy-sweet sound and a warm humor in constant evidence. But it wouldn't have lasted: lead songwriter John Sebastian was too willful and idiosyncratic, coming on like an American Ray Davies on songs such as &quot;Younger Generation,&quot; a prescient meditation on the hippie generation's future parental dilemmas. Greatest Hits is a fine 26-song introduction to a perennially underrated band. --Taylor Parkes\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Do you believe in magic                              [02:09]\n02.You didn't have to be so nice                        [02:29]\n03.Daydream                                             [02:22]\n04.You baby                                             [02:57]\n05.Did you ever have to make up your mind               [02:01]\n06.Wild about my lovin'                                 [02:37]\n07.Younger girl                                         [02:20]\n08.On the road again                                    [01:53]\n09.Didn't want to have to do it                         [02:39]\n10.Jug band music                                       [02:53]\n11.Summer in the city                                   [02:43]\n12.Rain on the roof                                     [02:14]\n13.Pow (theme from 'what's up tiger lily ')             [02:28]\n14.Nashville cats                                       [02:37]\n15.Lovin' you                                           [02:30]\n16.Darlin' companion                                    [02:23]\n17.Coconut grove                                        [02:44]\n18.Full measure                                         [02:42]\n19.Darling be home soon                                 [03:37]\n20.Lonely (amy's theme)                                 [03:24]\n21.You're A big boy now                                 [02:32]\n22.Six o'clock                                          [02:44]\n23.She is still A mystery                               [03:02]\n24.Money                                                [01:56]\n25.Younger generation                                   [02:43]\n26.Never going back                                     [02:50]\n________\n67:29 min\n100,7 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
