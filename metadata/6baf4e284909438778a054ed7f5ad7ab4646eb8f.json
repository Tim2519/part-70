He and his longtime love, Rose, have gone through with their much-deferred marriage ceremony, their adopted daughter, Miaow, a former street child, has become a lovingÃ¢â‚¬â€if sometimes difficultÃ¢â‚¬â€part of the family, and the three of them live in relative comfort thanks to Rose's housekeeping business and Rafferty's writing.\n\nThen a nightmare figure from Rose's time as a Patpong dancer barges into their world, shattering the peace they've worked so hard to obtain. His appearance threatens everything they cherish: their love, their home . . . their very lives. As a foreigner who's seen some of the worst Bangkok has to offer and survived confrontations with Thailand's most powerful and dangerous elements, Rafferty feels equal to most of the challenges Bangkok can throw at him. But now his only hope is to discover the whole truth of Rose's pastÃ¢â‚¬â€a journey down the dark and twisting road that turned a shy, awkward village teenager into the queen of Asia's most lurid red-light street: Patpong Road. And just when Rafferty thought life was looking good, reality comes crashing in as he learns that the secrets from Rose's former life are almost impossible to acceptÃ¢â‚¬â€and even harder to survive.\n\nThe Queen of Patpong is a terrifying, heart-breaking, electrifying story of peril, love, and, ultimately, redemption in modern-day ThailandÃ¢â‚¬â€and the most ambitious, affecting novel yet from thriller master Timothy Hallinan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6baf4e284909438778a054ed7f5ad7ab4646eb8f","amp;dn":"The+Queen+of+Patpong+%5BPoke+Rafferty+Mystery%2C+%234%5D+-+Timothy+Halli","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6baf4e284909438778a054ed7f5ad7ab4646eb8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,175,78,40,73,9,67,135,120,160,84,237,127,90,215,171,70,70,235,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
