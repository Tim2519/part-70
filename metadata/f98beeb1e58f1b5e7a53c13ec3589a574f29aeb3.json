In New York, police harassed a man for washing his car in his own private driveway. \n\nIn national news, a federal judge in Washington ruled that the NSA's domestic spying likely violates the Fourth Amendment and is &quot;almost Orwellian&quot; in scope. He also said that James Madison, the architect of the Constitution, would be aghast at the agency's dragnet. The plaintiff of the case, Larry Klayman, joins Alex to break down what this historic ruling means for Americans. \n\nWilliam F. Jasper, senior editor of The New American, also joins the show to explain in detail how the Trans-Pacific Partnership will erode U.S. sovereignty.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
