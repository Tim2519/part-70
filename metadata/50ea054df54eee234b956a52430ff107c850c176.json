Oh shit! It's a FIRST COMICS fill!!!!\n\nYou have before you a complete collection of the Lone Wolf and Cub comics published by First Comics. The series ran for 45 issues between 1987 and 1991. It should be noted that First went defunct before the entire story was finished. It should also be noted that, unlike the later Dark Horse reprints, First Comics rearranged the story somewhat and changed chapter sizes. Frank Miller provided covers and context for the first 12 issues or so, with later covers provided by Bill Sienkiewicz, Matt Wagner and Mike Ploog.\n\nAs ever, muchas gracias to the creators and the scanners! Get it, seed it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50ea054df54eee234b956a52430ff107c850c176","amp;dn":"Lone+Wolf+and+Cub+%28First+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50ea054df54eee234b956a52430ff107c850c176","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,234,5,77,245,78,238,35,75,149,106,82,67,15,241,7,200,80,193,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
