The pairing of Johnny Mathis' beautiful voice with the uncomprimising arrangements of Percy Faith and His Orchestra are one of the greatest matches in music history.\nJohnny's versions of &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot;, &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Silver Bells&quot;, &quot;The First Noel&quot;, and &quot;O Holy Night&quot; are as much a classic as Bing Crosby's &quot;White Christmas&quot;, Elvis' &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas&quot;, Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole's &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;, and Dean Martin's &quot;Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow.&quot;\n\nI can't think of a cd that says &quot;Christmas&quot; more than this one. Originally released in 1957, it is a timeless classic that should actually be passed on from generation to generation.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:679fc609a3f9231b1740527ac44f519f8f7291df","amp;dn":"Johnny+Mathis+-+Merry+Christmas+320cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"679fc609a3f9231b1740527ac44f519f8f7291df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,159,198,9,163,249,35,27,23,64,82,122,196,79,81,159,143,114,145,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
