But there are things in our prehistory &quot;about which we do not have the faintest idea,&quot; writes best-selling author Erich von DÃƒÂ¤niken in his gripping new book, Remnants of the Gods. Stone structures erected by master builders, mysterious underground complexes, geometrically aligned stone circles, the breathtaking pyramids of Egypt--who built them? And, perhaps more importantly, where did these builders obtain such incredible knowledge?\nErich von DÃƒÂ¤niken shows in detail how whole countries were surveyed thousands of years ago. Hundreds of Stone Age holy places are located at equal distances from one another, forming giant squares and triangles.\nHow was all of this possible? Classic archaeology provides no answers to these questions. Worse still, it doesn't even appear to be interested. Are we all threatening to become &quot;camp followers of disinterest,&quot; as Erich asks?\nFeaturing more than 160 color photos and illustrations, Erich reveals the secrets of &quot;impossible buildings&quot; in Europe and the Mediterranean region, describes &quot;crazy facts,&quot; and relentlessly exposes false doctrines.\nRemnants of the Gods will make even strident skeptics reconsider what they think they know of the past.\n\nAbout the Author\nErich von DÃƒÂ¤niken is arguably the most widely read and most-copied nonfiction author in the world.
