It is nice to see that the original complete 13-song version of the album is now available again. Our four children, now ages 14 to 34, all grew up listening to this recording. We own probably 50 Christmas CDs, ranging from classical to jazz to pop. If I could own only one Christmas CD, it would be this one. Exquisitely arranged and recorded, it is a true holiday classic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:934801dd64515e69247f210f01a4ee3be0ba0d4b","amp;dn":"The+Muppets+and+John+Denver-A+Christmas+Together","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"934801dd64515e69247f210f01a4ee3be0ba0d4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,72,1,221,100,81,94,105,36,127,33,15,1,164,238,59,224,186,13,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
