The group covered Louis Prima's &quot;Jump Jive an' Wail&quot;, which appeared on Prima's 1957 album The Wildest!. The BSO's follow up single was &quot;Gettin' In the Mood.&quot;\n\nIn 1990, Setzer organized the orchestra, styled as a big band which included full sections of trumpet, trombone and saxophone players, and a rhythm section with Setzer on guitar and vocals, plus piano, string bass and drums. The orchestra began playing clubs in and around Los Angeles, USA and was eventually signed to Hollywood Records.\n\nThe group released its first two albums in 1994 and 1996. There had been a change of labels, to Interscope Records. The band also had a slight change in orchestration, dropping the piano player. They were followed by The Dirty Boogie (1998), a mix of Setzer-penned originals and covers of swing standards. The orchestra then embarked on several U.S. and world tours.\n\nIn 2009 the orchestra released a new album titled Songs from Lonely Avenue. This was the first album to feature all original songs written by Setzer. Frank Comstock also worked on horn and string arrangements for the album.\n\nThe BSO often plays during the December holidays covering Christmas songs, and plays the Rockefeller Center tree-lighting ceremony. Setzer tunes have been used in commercials.\n\nBesides Setzer, the rhythm section is anchored by drummer Tony Pia and bassist Johnny Hatton. During live concert performances, Setzer often dismisses the horn players and plays a set of rockabilly using just this trio, in the manner of the Stray Cats.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_Of_Collection_%E2%80%93_Christmas_Rocks!&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_Of_Collection_%E2%80%93_Christmas_Rocks!&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fAeFjAAfK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fAeFjAAfK&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 7800kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:02:15\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
