It's a spectacular live set, but the way it's edited and sequenced makes it seem like a compilation.  The album begins with a bit of dialogue that places the song somewhere in the show other than the start, and the beginning of the show is after the first song.  \n\nSo I resequenced the thing several years ago, moving The Subhuman to the middle of the album.  When I did this I used the standard old issue of the disc.\n\nMore recently the Complete Columbia Recordings box set was released.  This box contained a remastered version of the album, plus the actual opening track from 1974, Stairway to the Stars.  Well I think the remastering was pretty pathetic.  The record was still flat and dull sounding.  \n\nSo this time I remastered the remaster, bringing the highs and lows up so it has crispness and punch and reinstating Stairway to the Stars as the opening track.  I kept The Subhuman in the middle of the set.  I moved ME 262 to the second last song so they don't say &quot;Goodnight&quot; and then keep playing.\n\nI also dubbed in some audience here and there to cover the crappy editing they did originally.\n\n01 Stairway to the Stars\n02 Harvester of Eyes\n03 Hot Rails to Hell\n04 The Red and the Black\n05 7 Screaming Diz-Busters\n06 Buck's Boogie\n07 The Subhuman\n08 Then Came the Last Days of May\n09 Cities on Flame\n10 Before the Kiss (a Redcap)\n11 Maserati GT (I Ain't Got You)\n12 ME 262\n13 Born to be Wild\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a57694f5d2d0de43d63081960261a899a388d4ef","amp;dn":"Blue+Oyster+Cult+-+On+Your+Feet+Or+On+Your+Knees+%28resequenced+an","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a57694f5d2d0de43d63081960261a899a388d4ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,118,148,245,210,208,222,67,214,48,129,150,2,97,168,153,163,136,212,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
