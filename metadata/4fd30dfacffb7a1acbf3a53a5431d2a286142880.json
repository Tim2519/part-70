Tensions result; bigotry and inhumanity are major themes.\n\nFor some years after 1945, the East German company DEFA was at the forefront of German film-making, producing such classics as The Murderers Are Among Us. It turned a lack of funding and equipment into advantages, producing gritty cinema-verite films about postwar upheaval and confusion.\n\nThe Bridge fits in nicely. My one grumble is the soundtrack - pretty music more appropriate to a Disney adventure.\n\nNo subtitles, it will help if you have some Germam.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fd30dfacffb7a1acbf3a53a5431d2a286142880","amp;dn":"Die+Brucke+%281949%29+The+Bridge+DEFA+refugee-film+very+rare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fd30dfacffb7a1acbf3a53a5431d2a286142880","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,211,13,250,207,251,122,26,203,243,165,58,84,49,210,162,134,20,40,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
