In addition to useful insights on lighting and posing techniques, it provides ample guidance on the delicate issue of the subjectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emotional comfortÃ¢â‚¬â€a critical factor in the success of the images and the client's happiness with the session. The book addresses different locations and natural versus artificial lighting scenarios, and also includes extensive postproduction tips and tricks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efa9890aa2b812b6a0b704599cd6c2080d7746a2","amp;dn":"Creating+Stylish+and+Sexy+Photography+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efa9890aa2b812b6a0b704599cd6c2080d7746a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,169,137,10,162,184,18,182,160,183,4,89,156,214,194,8,13,119,70,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
