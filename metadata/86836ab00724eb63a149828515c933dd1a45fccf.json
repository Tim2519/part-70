Tommy is suspicious, but is forced to accept the awkward friendship in order to enter a cooking contest with a big prize. And besides, it's so much easier to impress his crush, Sarah (Katherine McNamara), when he's not getting beat up by Matt and his team. As the cooking contest heats up, Sarah sniffs out a conspiracy, but nobody wants to hear about it. Can Tommy trust his budding friendship with Matt or is it all a huge joke on him?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86836ab00724eb63a149828515c933dd1a45fccf","amp;dn":"Contest+The+Movie+2013+TVRip+%28+Cartoon+Network+Premiere+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86836ab00724eb63a149828515c933dd1a45fccf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,131,106,176,7,36,235,99,161,73,130,133,21,201,51,221,26,69,252,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
