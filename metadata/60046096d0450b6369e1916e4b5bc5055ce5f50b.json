Martin P. Keerns. (2013)\n\n Greetings my fellow truth seeker. My name is Martin Keerns, I have passionately researched, compiled, and edited the following series of books for you with much love, care, and dedication over the last 5 years. - Thousands of hours of demanding work went into what you are about to read. \n\n I take great pleasure in finally being able to present to you this the first section of my work: - Hopefully this will have been for your benefit first of all, but perhaps also just a little bit for your pleasure. (As you will discover if you read this, I have quite a wicked and very dry sense of humour). \n\n These first four books when taken together make up just one small part of a meganormously extensive four part series of work that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve dubbed the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grand Unified Theory SeriesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nThis initial section has been titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Notice of IntentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (This is for a number of reasons that will become abundantly clear to anyone who does bother to read it all the way through).\n\n This section deals with a whole range of issues, ALL concerning one thing in particular - CONTROL.\n\n Part One - Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sex, Drugs, Rock and KontrolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ The first book looks at social control, being enforced through mind control, largely for the purpose of population control. I also lay out hundreds of pages of very hard hitting no-punches-pulled information, (including some quite rare or Ã¢â‚¬Å“hard to come byÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ articles) on a subject that REALLY rips my knitting more than anything else. - Organised paedophilia.\n\n Part Two - Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dumbed down word controlled monkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s who think that keeping up with the JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and not being the stupidest guy or gal in the room is ALL that really mattersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ concentrates on the multi-faceted and ubiquitous methods of mind control that are routinely being used on entire populations by our wanabee owners to train, manipulate, condition, and herd, (yet at the same time alienate us from each other) every single day of our lives from the womb to the cold dark tomb. \n\n Part Three - Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Needle and the Damage DoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ this third part of the section quite literally bulges to the point of bursting trying to contain all of the crucial facts detailing all the different Ã¢â‚¬Å“weaponsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that are being utilised by the small group of rich, influential psychoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (who we allow to be in charge) who collectively are doing EVERYTHING they can to limit our numbers using population control. \n\n Part Four - To end the first section we have Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Random Collection of Conspiracy Facts for One to Theorise OnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which demonstrates the truly endemic nature of all this control that I have been highlighting in the previous three works. There are subjects that could have been included in the earlier parts but that ultimately didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it solely because I tried to maintain Ã¢â‚¬Å“themesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the earlier books. - But that has absolutely no bearing on their quality, (in fact my first chapter on the moon landings, in my own honest, humble, and modest opinion, nails this subject better than any other individual has done on their own before me). The second half of the book also seriously examines, in great detail, money, banking, and world finance in general for some 500 odd pages.\n I saw which way the wind was blowing before I ever started this project, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve known right from day one that it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be too long a period of time before our would be owners would find ways to limit our access to the treasure trove of information that is Ã¢â‚¬Å“the netÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Blocking sites, disappearing sites (articles and books), subscription only access to newspaper archives - these have all proven my hunch to be right. That is why all of my books contain hundreds of these articles in their entirety. They also contain loads of diagrams, charts, graphs, pictures, and the original documents that I cite. \n\n This was always intended to be a comprehensive reference work from its inception (which is why the books are each on average something like 900 pages long). This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a quick concise opinion or two:\n This is truly a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grand Unified TheoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nEnjoy, and please do make an effort to share. Much Love to you all. Your good friend Martin Keerns.\n\n INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST SECTION Ã¢â‚¬Å“NOTICE OF INTENTÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ AND SOME LEGAL KUNG-FU. Pages 1 to 59.\n CONTENTS - Pages 61 to 62. DEDICATION Page 64\n\n Part One: Sex, Drugs, Rock and Kontrol. \n\n Chapter One - Pages 65 to 116 WHY THIS WORK WAS PUT TOGETHER AT ALL AND ALSO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE AUTHOR. - A brief overview of Greenock, which is my place of birth, and also a few odd things that I had noticed during my youth which led me to become curious enough to compile this work. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a small collection of information I have compiled that my Scottish brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and sisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s should be paying some serious attention to.\n Chapter Two - Pages 118 to 136 THE FRANKFURT SCHOOL, polymorphous perversity, and the origins and true aims of political correctness. This chapter looks at the root cause of many of the problems discussed in this work. - ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to believe, but political correctness was solely designed to obliterate society!\n\n Chapter Three - Pages 138 to 162 IF FEMINISM IS A WOMENÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S MOVEMENT, WHY ARE MEN FUNDING AND PROMOTING IT? - Why are the same people funding feminism, planned-parenthood, and sterilisation programmes world-wide? - TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re also hiding the fact they own the patent to the pill, and the morning after pill. Why does the name Rockefeller pop up repeatedly when looking at these issues?\n\n Chapter Four - Pages 164 to 226 THE TRUE AND VERY NUTTY GOALS OF FEMINISM, AND ALL IN THEIR OWN WORDS. - Here we look at the actual stated goals of feminism. With every quote coming directly from one of feminismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so called luminaries. Plus, just who exactly are Gloria Steinman and Margaret Sanger, and why are they so important to both feminism, and also this story?\n\n Chapter Five - Pages 228 to 272 THE EFFECTS OF FEMINISM ON US ALL, AND ALSO A BIT ON THE FEMINISATION OF MEN. - I reflect, with the help of others, on the effects of feminism on the whole of society. I then touch upon the rather touchy subjects of male fertility and also male feminisation.\n\n Chapter Six - Pages 274 to 307 SORRY GUYS BUT HOMOSEXUALITY ISNÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T GENETIC. Plus: Why are certain people pushing for gay adoption when in lots of cases it clearly seems to harm the welfare of the child?\n\n Chapter Seven - Pages 309 to 357 I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST ANYONE WHO IS GAY - THIS IS ABOUT KIDS. - THE CLEAR LINKS BETWEEN GAY MEN AND PAEDOPHILIA, AND GAY MEN AND SERIAL KILLING. As much as these two jaw dropping points might sound like the kind of subjects that would only be discussed on a Nazi version of Jerry Springer, they are in fact both points which are undeniably, and also more importantly, provably, true.\n\n Chapter Eight - Pages 359 to 402 THE SEXUALISATION OF CHILDREN - why are we forcing kids to deal with their sexuality at an age when they are still having trouble with not peeing themselves, or undoing a button?\n\n Chapter Nine - Pages 404 to 450 Ã¢â‚¬Å“THE PEDOPHOCRACYÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ PARTS I - VI. BY DAVE MCGOWAN. - I call upon the work of a man who I personally consider to be the greatest living writer in the world today in order to help prove my case to you about state sponsored paedophilia.\n\n Chapter Ten - Pages 452 to 468 DOCUMENTÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S SHOWING THE CIA COVERED UP (OR RAN) AN ORGANISED PAEDOPHILE RING. - These documents about Government sanctioned paedophilia are to compliment one of the issues broached in the last chapter. They are a police statement, provided by a policeman.\n\n Chapter Eleven - Pages 470 to 546 MORE RECENT EXAMPLES OF STATE SPONSORED/SANCTIONED PAEDOPHILIA. - I now concentrate on British State sponsored/condoned, or at the very fucking least, hushed and covered-up, kid fiddling (a harrowing story that requires two whole chapters).\n\n Chapter Twelve - Pages 548 to 624 This second chapter of my (mainly) British Paedophilia information DISCUSSES THE SEEMINGLY CLOSE LINK BETWEEN POLITICS AND PAEDOPHILIA, and also details a shocking example of a paedoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ cover up, at the highest level, that everyone needs to know about from here in Scotland. If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t read another page of this at least google Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hollie GreigÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nChapter Thirteen - Page 626 to 706 THE SAME PEOPLE THAT ARE JAILING YOU FOR DRUGS ARE SELLING YOU THEM. - I think this title says it all donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you? This is the first of my three chapters on Ã¢â‚¬Å“drugsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nChapter Fourteen Pages - 708 to 752 THE DRUGS WAR IS NOTHING PERSONAL ITÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S JUST VERY GOOD BUSINESS.\n\n Chapter Fifteen - Page 754 to 814 EXTRACTS FROM THE BOOK Ã¢â‚¬Å“ACID DREAMSÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ BY MARTIN A. LEE AND BRUCE SHLAIN THAT WILL CONCLUSIVELY SHOW THE CIA GAVE US LSD. - To end this, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“drugsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ part of my work, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll concentrate on the subjectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of the CIA, LSD, and also the links between all of these and the hippie movement.\n\n Chapter Sixteen - Page 816 to 882 INSIDE THE LC: THE STRANGE BUT MOSTLY TRUE STORY OF LAUREL CANYON AND THE BIRTH OF THE HIPPIE GENERATION BY DAVE MCGOWAN. - To end this first part of my work I will let this talented man (also with some help from Alex Constantine with reference to the deaths of Bob and Jimi) show you the dark side of the story of Rock and Roll (a side of it that you have, more than likely, NEVER read about before) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60046096d0450b6369e1916e4b5bc5055ce5f50b","amp;dn":"Sex%2C+Drugs%2C+Rock+and+Kontrol+%7BMartin+P+Keerns%7D+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60046096d0450b6369e1916e4b5bc5055ce5f50b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,4,96,150,208,69,11,99,105,225,145,110,75,91,197,5,92,229,245,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
