In the transitional days of 1990Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s hardcore, they were a bright spot. Their music picked up the theoretical thread laid down by Quicksand and ran with it. Their live shows were blazing.\n\nThe band featured Julian Vasquez on vocals, Manny Carrerro on bass, Orlando Arce on guitar and Dimi Douvas on drums. They recorded one demo, one EP (Green Spock Ears, Wreck-Age Records) , and one full length LP (At The Speed of Light, TVT/ Building Records ).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c01f214227563d239127cbe8ef8a8c3e89bc1b1b","amp;dn":"Stillsuit+-+NYC+Hardcore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c01f214227563d239127cbe8ef8a8c3e89bc1b1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,31,33,66,39,86,61,35,145,39,203,232,239,138,140,62,137,188,27,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
