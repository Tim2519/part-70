Afraid for his life, Roberts scales a tree and vows to stay there until the danger is gone. Unfortunately for him, the unsavory Shark (Cle Bennett) is equally determined to wait for Murray to come down and finish the robbing as he had intended, and an all-night standoff quickly ensues. Get Down premiered at the 2002 Toronto Film Festival.\n\nUPC: 096009143497\n\n90min\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:318e355a39886a7f0ea5ad9cf7cabf28ae349d79","amp;dn":"Get+Down+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"318e355a39886a7f0ea5ad9cf7cabf28ae349d79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,142,53,90,57,136,106,127,14,165,173,156,247,202,191,40,174,52,157,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
