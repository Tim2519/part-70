They are skilled asrtists.  This is simply amazing church type choir music that seems to blend choir and chant in some songs, cobnjuring up how songs would sound like 1,500 years ago. Very soothing, spiritual and relaxing.  I have it listed as Christmas music since Ava Maria is in there but it appears this music is for all seasons. - Big Papi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dfb1e5a055d47ef1c773160275d708e7768180e","amp;dn":"Voices+of+Ascension+-+Ava+Maria+320cbr+1993+Christmas+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dfb1e5a055d47ef1c773160275d708e7768180e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,251,30,90,5,93,71,239,28,119,49,96,39,93,112,142,119,104,24,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
