Shannon couldn't stop thinking about it, but can she let go of the doubts and go through with it? Shannon is happily married and very much in love with her husband, Nate. Her feelings are thrown for a loop when his best friend, Zac, moves in temporarily. His intense stares and naughty whispers about a menage ignite something inside Shannon, but she says nothing to Nate. After all, Zac will be moving on soon, and there's no reason to upset her husband over nothing. But Zac keeps pushing, and Nate doesn't seem all that mad at the possibility of a menage with Zac. Can her marriage survive if the three of them go to bed together? Can it survive if they don't?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eae61c7bd277676623e86fadbdedde18f7d5774f","amp;dn":"All+or+Nothing+by+Jessica+Jarman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eae61c7bd277676623e86fadbdedde18f7d5774f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,230,28,123,210,119,103,102,35,232,111,173,189,237,222,24,247,213,119,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
