Admiral, naval hero, pirate, warrior and empire-builder, Kheir ed-Din or Barbarossa, as he was known in the West, was a legendary figure. Born on Lesbos in Greece he rose to become High Admiral of the Ottoman Navy, Sultan of Algiers and friend and advisor to Suleiman the Magnificent. His life dominated the history of the Mediterranean in the 16th century. From the moment that he and his brother, Aruj, established themselves on the North African coast, the pattern of life and trade in the Mediterranean changed forever and for nearly 300 years after it was affected by the activities of raiders from what came to be called the Barbary Coast. His achievements in reorganizing the Ottoman Navy and his command of it helped the expansion of the Turkish Empire that threatened all of Europe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9429dd19c5f3f726356f38b84ce79025884c1b1","amp;dn":"The+Sultan%27s+Admiral+Barbarossa+Pirate+and+Empire+Builder+Little","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9429dd19c5f3f726356f38b84ce79025884c1b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,66,157,209,156,95,63,114,99,86,243,139,132,206,121,2,88,132,193,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
