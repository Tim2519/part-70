Moffat was a poor student of math and science. That is, until he read Einstein's famous paper on general relativity. Realizing instantly that he had an unusual and unexplained aptitude for understanding the complex physics described in the paper, Moffat wrote a letter to Einstein that would change the course of his life.\n\nEinstein Wrote Back tells the story of Moffat's unusual entry into the world of academia and documents his career at the frontlines of twentieth-century physics as he worked and associated with some of the greatest minds in scientific history, including Niels Bohr, Fred Hoyle, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, Erwin SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Abdus Salam, among others.\n\nTaking readers inside the classrooms and minds of these giants of modern science, Moffat affectionately exposes the foibles and eccentricities of these great men, as they worked on the revolutionary ideas that, today, are the very foundation of modern physics and cosmology.\n\nReview\n\nMoffat ably renders controversies in physics in layman's terms, and has a gift for explaining complex ideas without seeming to patronize. Best of all, the entertainment quotient of the books is high, and his portraits of the giants he has known are illuminating and frequently hilarious.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJohn W. Moffat is the author of Reinventing Gravity: A Physicist Goes Beyond Einstein. He is a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto and an adjunct professor at the University of Waterloo, as well as a member of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:881dc7a0361a86a81e2bd02cfee1c55898335452","amp;dn":"Einstein+Wrote+Back+-+John+W.+Moffat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"881dc7a0361a86a81e2bd02cfee1c55898335452","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,29,199,160,54,26,134,168,30,43,208,44,254,225,197,88,152,51,84,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
