After forming from the ashes of several other Big Apple industrial bands -- with a lineup including programmer and guitarist Lupia, vocalist Vas Kallas, bassist Ginger Bread and drummer Pat Wolff -- Hanzel Und Gretyl appeared on a compilation called COP International Chaos. New York's Energy Records became interested and signed the band for their debut album, Ausgeflippt, released in late 1995. After appearing on several dates with Marilyn Manson and touring around the U.S., the quartet returned with sophomore album Transmissions from Uranus in 1997. \n\n\nGenre................: Industrial\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1997\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Cover, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\n01.Black Forest Galaxy\n02.9D Galactic Center\n03.Pleiadian Agenda\n04.Take Me To Your Leader\n05.Zeta Reticula\n06.Komet Ride\n07.Trance Planet Vortex\n08.Robot Logik\n09.Helium Popsicles\n10.Starfucker\n11.Hyper Erotic Joy Helmet\n12.Mutant Starseed Creation\n13.Fireball Xl5\n14.Hallo Berlin\n15.Astronafti\n16.Om Zentrale Station\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58505f40fdcd5297e935b3ff9d628bd08b821025","amp;dn":"Hanzel+und+Gretyl+-+Transmissions+From+Uranus+1997+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58505f40fdcd5297e935b3ff9d628bd08b821025","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,80,95,64,253,205,82,151,233,53,179,255,157,98,139,208,139,130,16,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
