There is a daughter, abandoned because of an impulsive marriage, an aunt who pines for lost love, and a bridegroom with the biggest problem of them all.\n\nSet in England and the fictional village of Gulistan in Pakistan, with its fascinating array of quirky, eccentric and unforgettable characters, Revolt centres on the forthcoming marriage of two rich cousins and the often hilarious but always deeply moving pitfalls and perils of living in a place where everyone knows everybody elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s business. Underpinning the action is the compulsive and pervading need to resolve the conflict between Pakistani Muslim values and those of the modern West.\n\nA brilliantly incisive portrait of small-town life, exploding into a panoramic portrayal of the nature of change, freedom, pride and prejudice,Revolt also reminds us of a darker, more threatening world. Immensely readable, dramatic and beautifully evocative, this book will enthral, as the action unfolds and the tensions play out to their startling resolution.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c456cbab6744a0986d9206a7666b30d7ba3b672","amp;dn":"Revolt+-+Qaisra+Shahraz.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c456cbab6744a0986d9206a7666b30d7ba3b672","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,69,108,186,182,116,74,9,134,217,32,106,118,102,179,13,123,163,182,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
