Harshbarger and James J. Reynolds \nCengage Learning | January 2012 | ISBN-10: 9781133106234 | True PDF | 1088 pages | 122 mb\n\nMATHEMATICAL APPLICATIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT, LIFE, AND SOCIAL SCIENCES, 10th Edition, is intended for a two-semester applied calculus or combined finite mathematics and applied calculus course. The book's concept-based approach, multiple presentation methods, and interesting and relevant applications keep students who typically take the course--business, economics, life sciences, and social sciences majors--engaged in the material. This edition broadens the book's real-life context by adding a number of environmental science and economic applications. The use of modeling has been expanded, with modeling problems now clearly labeled in the examples. Also included in the Tenth Edition is a brief review of algebra to prepare students with different backgrounds for the material in later chapters.\n\nAbout the Authors\nA professor at the University of South Carolina, Ron Harshbarger has worked with Jim Reynolds on MATHEMATICAL APPLICATIONS since the book's inception. Like his co-author, he has taught for over 20 years, at all levels of undergraduate mathematics.\nA professor at Clarion University in Pennsylvania, Jim Reynolds has worked with Ron Harshbarger on MATHEMATICAL APPLICATIONS since the book's inception.
