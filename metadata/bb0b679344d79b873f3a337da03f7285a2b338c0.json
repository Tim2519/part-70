Developed by Northrop Grumman, the drone is small enough to be towed on a flatbed trailer behind a pick-up truck. \n\nIn other news, banks are threatening to start charging consumers fees for depositing money into their bank accounts. \n\nDan Bongino, an author and a former member of the Secret Service's Presidential Protection Division, joins the show to reveal the inner workings of the Obama administration and the catalyst which caused him to leave his 12-year career with the Secret Service.\n\nNOTE: This is the PrisonPlanet members' edit, from which scheduled commercial breaks have been removed. It is the whole broadcast in one MP3.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
