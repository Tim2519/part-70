I think Parker was 16 when this was recorded. On the Jimmy Fallon show he said they made $500 selling these at their high school and he quit his job at Pizza Hut. Good story.\n\nThis is not the whole album, only part of it. It is quite obscure and not all of the tracks have been digitized as it was recorded on cassette. If you have a copy, digitize it.\n\nFull Track List:\n\nSide One:\n\n01 - Dead Ballerina\n02 - Au Jus - Missing\n03 - I Spit On Your Love\n04 - Gotta Find That Train\n05 - You Jerk\n06 - Gonna Find U and Kill U - Missing\n\nSide Two:\n\n07 - Immature - Missing\n08 - Without Lips\n09 - You're Not Worth The Dirt On The Lint Between My Toes - Missing\n10 - I'm In Love With Myself\n11 - Sri Lankan Woman\n12 - Twin Brothers In Love\n13 - Bitch - Missing\n\nDead Ballerina is my favorite.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad99c9fe5a1141b0feaf77778935dbfcf76f3019","amp;dn":"Immature+-+A+collection+of+love+ballads+for+the+80s+man+%28Trey+Pa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad99c9fe5a1141b0feaf77778935dbfcf76f3019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,153,201,254,90,17,65,176,254,175,119,119,137,53,219,252,247,111,48,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
