World even incorporates almost exact replicas of the cities of Rockport and Palmont, the cities of Most Wanted and Carbon respectively, into its map design.It also features a bit of the &quot;Underground 2&quot; in the free roam. World was originally scheduled for an Asian release in the summer of 2009, however the game was not released at that time and it was released worldwide on July 27, 2010.[137][138] In October 2009, the game was in public beta-testing limited to residents of Taiwan.\n\nThe beta was launched on June 2, 2010.
