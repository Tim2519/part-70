This Festschrift volume, published in honour of J. Ian Munro, contains contributions written by some of his colleagues, former students, and friends. In celebration of his 66th birthday the colloquium &quot;Conference on Space Efficient Data Structures, Streams and Algorithms&quot; was held in Waterloo, ON, Canada, during August 15-16, 2013. The articles presented herein cover some of the main topics of Ian's research interests. Together they give a good overall perspective of the last 40 years of research in algorithms and data structures.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nThe Query Complexity of Finding a Hidden Permutation.- Bounds for Scheduling Jobs on Grid Processors.- Quake Heaps: A Simple Alternative to Fibonacci Heaps.- Variations on Instant Insanity.- A Simple Linear-Space Data Structure for Constant-Time Range.- Closing a Long-Standing Complexity Gap for Selection: V3(42) = 50.- Frugal Streaming for Estimating Quantiles.- From Time to Space: Fast Algorithms That Yield Small and Fast Data.- Computing (and life) Is all About Tradeoffs: A Small Sample of Some Computational Tradeoffs.- A History of Distribution-Sensitive Data Structures.- A Survey on Priority Queues.- On Generalized Comparison-Based Sorting Problems.- A Survey of the Game Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lights Out!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½.- Random Access to High-Order Entropy Compressed Text.- Succinct and Implicit Data Structures for Computational Geometry.- In Pursuit of the Dynamic Optimality Conjecture.- A Survey of Algorithms and Models for List Update.- Orthogonal Range Searching for Text Indexing.- A Survey of Data Structures in the Bitprobe Model.- Succinct Representations of Ordinal Trees.- Array Range Queries.- Indexes for Document Retrieval with Relevance.\n\nSeries: Lecture Notes in Computer Science / Theoretical Computer Science and General Issues \nPaperback: 391 pages\nPublisher: Springer; 2013 edition (August 7, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3642402720\nISBN-13: 978-3642402722\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
