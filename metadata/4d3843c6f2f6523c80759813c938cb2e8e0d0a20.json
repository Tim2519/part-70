The PS2 version of the game was the first remake of the SNES classic and featured enhanced 3D graphics as well as several other features that were absent from the original version (having a four member party system instead of three and the inclusion of the Bag inventory system, which effectively granted unlimited storage space, though the items carried by the characters themselves were still limited). The monster taming system from the original SNES version is also in place and was one of the first, if not the very first, games to include such a mechanic, well before even the popular PokÃƒÂ©mon franchise.\n\nBe sure to read the included PDF Readme file in order to properly patch the game. You must follow the steps EXACTLY as listed in the Readme or the game will not load in either a real PS2 or an emulator.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d3843c6f2f6523c80759813c938cb2e8e0d0a20","amp;dn":"Dragon+Quest+V+-+Tenkuu+no+Hanayome+PS2+ENG+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d3843c6f2f6523c80759813c938cb2e8e0d0a20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,56,67,198,242,246,82,60,128,117,152,19,201,56,203,46,142,13,10,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
