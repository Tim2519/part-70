The Second World War ended in 1943. Hitler never declared war on the United States and is currently master of an empire that stretches from the Atlantic coastline of France to the Ural Mountains in Russia. Hundreds of millions are dead or enslaved as Hitler's followers make his dreams real, but the Fuhrer is still not satisfied. To the west, Britain remains independent - and, beyond it, the United States of America.\n\nSince 1943, the world has enjoyed an uneasy peace.\n\nThat is about to change...\n\nAuthor:\n\nChristopher Nuttall has been planning sci-fi books since he learned to read. Born and raised in Edinburgh, Chris created an alternate history website and eventually graduated to writing full-sized novels. Studying history independently allowed him to develop worlds that hung together and provided a base for storytelling. After graduating from university, Chris started writing full-time. The Royal Sorceress is his first novel to be professionally published. Chris is currently living in Borneo with his partner, muse, and critic Aisha.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77187a21dea02a438899600276a1bb7ee1e1ca3f","amp;dn":"The+Invasion+of+1950+%282013%29+Christopher+Nuttall+%28multi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77187a21dea02a438899600276a1bb7ee1e1ca3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,24,122,33,222,160,42,67,136,153,96,2,118,161,187,126,225,225,202,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
