US Dec 1967, UK 1968)  [mp3, 192 kbps]\n\n\nincludes cover scans and images.\n\n\nClassic psych album from Cleveland, Ohio.  Some sources give 1968 or even 1969 for this album.  It was first released in the US on 11th December 1967 by a little-known label called Mainstream.  It was then re-released in the UK the following year by Fontana.  The band broke up in 1968, and this was their only recording (although four tracks were lifted from it for two 7&quot; singles).\n\nTrack 6 is the only non-original, and is called 'Softly To Me'.  It is a cover version of a song written by Bryan MacLean and sung by Arthur Lee on Love's first album.  (NB, it is not 'Come Softly To Me' - as mis-stated on the album cover by the designer at the time, much to the band's fury - an entirely different song which had been a hit for The Fleetwoods in 1959.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7154fbef7f0333de7f310e2dea9b76a27335f36","amp;dn":"The+Tiffany+Shade+-+album+%28rel.+US+Dec+1967%2C+UK+1968%29+%5B192+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7154fbef7f0333de7f310e2dea9b76a27335f36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,21,79,190,247,240,51,61,231,243,16,226,222,169,183,106,39,51,95,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
