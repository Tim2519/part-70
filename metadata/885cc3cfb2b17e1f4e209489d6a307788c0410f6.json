Investigating a crazed collector who's begun destroying prized masterworks, Glass is thrust into a bizarre hostage negotiation that takes him undercover at the Phoenix FoundationÃ¢â‚¬â€dedicated to the science of past-life study. There, to maintain his cover, he submits to the treatment of a hypnotist.\n\nUnder hypnosis, Glass travels from ancient Greece to nineteenth-century Persia, while the case takes him from New York to Paris and the movie while the case takes him from New York to Paris and the movie capital of the world. These journeys will change his very understanding of reality, lead him to question his own sanity and land him at the center of perhaps the most audacious art heist in history: a fifteen-hundred-year-old sculpture the nation of Iran will do anything to recover.\n\n**\n\nReview\n\nIf you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been reading M.J. RoseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Reincarnationist series, then THE HYPNOTIST will blow away any excuse you may have had... A memorable, engrossing read, a story that sets a new bar for Rose. Something for everyone: murder, suspense, history, romance, the supernatural, mystery and erotica. These elements are woven together so skillfully that the whole becomes something new and different.... Rose, who never disappoints either her die-hard fans or the casual reader, has surpassed herself. \n--Bookreporter.com\n\nThe Hypnotist is the very definition of thriller: threats modern and ancient, winding around one of the world's great museums, with a cast of compelling individuals who move through gloriously exotic settings. M. J. Rose tells a story built on the idea that saving love is indistinguishable from saving the world. \n-- NYT Bestseller Laurie R. King\n\nRose's work defies comparison, The Hypnotist so cutting edge that the pages stop just short of slicing your fingers as you race to turn them. She draws us into a world totally of her own making, and the result is a slick, ambitious, and beautifully written tale. \n---Providence Journal\n\nFascinating characters, an incredibly complex plot and a hint of the paranormal make this books simply unforgettable.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ RT Book ReviewsÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Top Pick 4 Ã‚Â½ stars\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nStarred Review. In this stunning page-turner, Rose's third Reincarnationist novel (after The Memorist), special agent Lucian Glass of the FBI's Art Crime Team continues to pursue Malachai Samuels of the Phoenix Foundation as well as the list of Memory Tools (deep meditation aids that help people access past-life memories) that Malachai covets. After a stolen Matisse painting arrives back at New York's Metropolitan Museum slashed to bits, the thief warns that four more stolen paintings by major artists will be destroyed unless the museum gives him Hypnos, an eight-foot-tall sculpture, which could help a person gain paranormal powers. The Matisse was taken 20 years earlier from the gallery of Andre Jacobs, father of Lucian's first love, Solange, who was killed during the heist. Lucian becomes attracted to Emeline, Andre's niece and adopted daughter, whose mannerisms and facial expressions eerily resemble Solange's. As Lucian recovers previous-life memories, his present life takes ever more shocking turns. This series inspired Fox TV's Past Life, which debuted in February. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:885cc3cfb2b17e1f4e209489d6a307788c0410f6","amp;dn":"The+Hypnotist+%5B%233%2C+Reincarnationist%5D+-+M.+J.+Rose","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"885cc3cfb2b17e1f4e209489d6a307788c0410f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,92,195,207,178,177,126,31,78,32,148,137,214,163,7,120,140,4,16,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
