Under his near-obsessive guidance, young ballerina Victoria Page is poised for superstardom, but earns Lermontov's scorn when she falls in love with Julian Craster, composer of &quot;The Red Shoes,&quot; the ballet Lermontov is staging to showcase her talents. Vicky leaves the company and marries Craster, but still finds herself torn between Lermontov's demands and those of her heart.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040725/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040725/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGreek subs in separate srt file.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fccb655c192907415418e0d702a32dbd3d6694e7","amp;dn":"The+Red+Shoes+1948+%5BEN%2CGRsubs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fccb655c192907415418e0d702a32dbd3d6694e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,203,101,92,25,41,7,65,84,24,224,215,2,163,45,189,61,102,148,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
