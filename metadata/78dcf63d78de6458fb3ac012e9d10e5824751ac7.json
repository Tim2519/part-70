It was the artist's biggest production to date, being co-produced by Philippe Eidel, Don Was, Jean-Jacques Goldman and Clive Hunt, and including performances by many other singers from around the world. It features what is perhaps Khaled's most popular song, &quot;AÃƒÂ¯cha&quot;. Most tracks are sung in Arabic, with a notable dosage of French. The title track is named after Khaled's first daughter, Sarah, to whom the album is dedicated along with her mother, Samira.\n\nTrack listing:\n&quot;Sahra&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:12\n&quot;Oran Marseille (Oran mix)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:08\n&quot;AÃƒÂ¯cha&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:19\n&quot;Lillah&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:24\n&quot;Ouelli El Darek&quot; (with the I Threes) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:11\n&quot;Detni Essekra&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:58\n&quot;Walou Walou&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:17\n&quot;Ki Kounti&quot; (with SaÃƒÂºl HernÃƒÂ¡ndez) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:40\n&quot;Wahrane Wahrane&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:40\n&quot;Haya Haya&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:37\n&quot;Mektoubi&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:55\n&quot;Hey Ouedi&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:12\n&quot;Oran Marseille&quot; (with Akhenaton and Shurik'n of IAM) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:25\n&quot;Sratli&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:36\n&quot;Le jour viendra&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:42","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78dcf63d78de6458fb3ac012e9d10e5824751ac7","amp;dn":"Chab+Khaled+-+Sahra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78dcf63d78de6458fb3ac012e9d10e5824751ac7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,220,246,61,120,222,100,88,251,58,192,18,233,209,14,88,36,117,26,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
