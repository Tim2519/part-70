It is the opening track on their second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare. The song was released as the first single from the album on 2 April 2007, debuting at No. 21 in the UK Singles Chart via downloads alone. The single was released in physical formats on 16 April, the week before the release of the album, and charted at #2 in the UK Singles Chart behind BeyoncÃƒÂ© and Shakira's &quot;Beautiful Liar&quot;.\n\nIt is the band's fourth single in the United Kingdom, following number ones &quot;I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor&quot;, and &quot;When the Sun Goes Down&quot;, as well as the non-album track &quot;Leave Before the Lights Come On&quot;.\n\nThe song was noticeably louder and heavier than previous efforts, marking the band's evolved sound.\n\nIt remains their highest charting single worldwide, reaching number two in the UK Singles Chart, behind Shakira's Beautiful Liar, number one in the UK Indie Chart, number one in Canada, number four in the Netherlands and number 28 in Italy.\n\nThe music video for the song, directed by Huse Monfaradi, features the band playing in a sparse sepia set, interspersed with clips of female dancers in front of a large computerised display, stock footage from old medical educational programs and brief flashes of images of objects mentioned in the lyrics, such as &quot;Brian&quot;, &quot;jacuzzi&quot; and lightning in place of &quot;thunder&quot;. The video was recorded on 14 February 2007, the same day as the 2007 BRIT Awards, leading to them missing the ceremony and instead sending two video acceptance messages where they dressed as Wizard of Oz characters and The Village People. The video premiered on MTV2 on 17 March 2007.\n\nArctic Monkeys are an English indie rock band formed in 2002 in High Green, a suburb of Sheffield. The band consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, lead/rhythm guitar), Jamie Cook (rhythm/lead guitar), Nick O'Malley (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Matt Helders (drums, backing vocals). Former member Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released.\n\nThe band's debut album became the fastest-selling debut album in British music history, surpassing Elastica's self-titled album and remains the fastest-selling debut album by a group in the UK. The band have won five Brit AwardsÃ¢â‚¬â€winning Best British Group twice, and have twice been nominated for Grammy Awards. The band also won the Mercury Prize for their debut album, in addition to receiving two nominations in 2007 and 2013.\n\nArctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first group of acts to come to the public attention via the Internet (fan-based sites rather than from the band), with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. The band are also regarded as one of the most prominent bands to be part of the post-punk revival in the UK, after achieving commercial success and spawning two number one singles with their debut album.\n(video has a 5 semi-transparent blue dots at the bottom right)\n\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brianstorm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brianstorm&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JaenlAaFD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JaenlAaFD&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:02:52\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
