This includes information about how the size of illuminating objects affects the GI calculations the GI Area Light attribute and GI portals.\nWith an idea of what goes into sampling the scene you will then explore the various GI methods including primary (Irradiance Cache Quasi-Monte Carlo) and secondary bounces (Irradiance Cache Quasi-Monte Carlo Radiosity Maps and Light Mapping).\nAfter going over the various GI methods you will then be introduced to working with caches for the Irradiance Cache Radiosity Maps and Light Mapping.\nFinally the series wraps up with two example scenes. The first scene covers working with the Irradiance Cache to render an interior that has an animated camera and the second explores using the Irradiance Cache or QMC when there are animated objects in the scene.\n\n\nMore info \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cineversity.com/vidplaylist/r15_global_illuminations&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cineversity.com/vidplaylist/r15_global_illuminations&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59bdb6233d81f6d3451c17f443beb2ad652869e9","amp;dn":"Cineversity+%26ndash%3B+R15+Global+Illuminations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59bdb6233d81f6d3451c17f443beb2ad652869e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,189,182,35,61,129,246,211,69,28,23,244,67,190,178,173,101,40,105,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
