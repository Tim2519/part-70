Eager for a fresh start, Audra plans to leave Portland for a new job in Philadelphia. Her seven-year-old son, Jack, seems apprehensive about flyingÃ¢â‚¬â€but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the beginning of an anxiety that grows to consume him.\n\nAs JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fears continue to surface in recurring and violent nightmares, Audra hardly recognizes the introverted boy he has become. Desperate, she traces snippets of information unearthed in JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dreams, leading her to Sean Malloy, a struggling US Army veteran wounded in Afghanistan. Together they unravel a mystery dating back to World War II, and uncover old family secrets that still have the strength to woundÃ¢â‚¬â€and perhaps, at last, to heal.\n\n&quot;The Pieces We Keep gripped me from the first page and didn't let go.&quot;\n-- Alyson Richman, bestselling author of The Lost Wife\n\n&quot;[A] sensitive and multilayered story where the discovery of long-held family secrets leads to healing.&quot;\n-- Beth Hoffman, New York Times bestselling author of Saving CeeCee Honeycutt\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Elegant and captivating...I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want this novel to end.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n-- Erika Robuck, bestselling author of Call Me Zelda\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A beautifully woven story, at once gripping and uplifting.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n-- Margaret Leroy, author of The Soldier's Wife\n\n&quot;A perfect combination of historical fiction and modern mystery.&quot;\n-- Amy Hatvany, author of Heart Like Mine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4515f7a34ab0f0e40b3cf13da0d062797b74dd5","amp;dn":"The+Pieces+We+Keep+-+Kristina+McMorris.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4515f7a34ab0f0e40b3cf13da0d062797b74dd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,81,95,122,52,171,15,14,64,179,207,19,218,13,6,39,151,183,77,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
