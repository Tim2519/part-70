According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the version sung by Bing Crosby is the best-selling single of all time, with estimated sales in excess of 50 million copies worldwide.\n\nAccounts vary as to when and where Berlin wrote the song.[4] One story is that he wrote it in 1940, in warm La Quinta, California, while staying at the La Quinta Hotel, a frequent Hollywood retreat also favored by writer-producer Frank Capra, although the Arizona Biltmore also claims the song was written there.[5] He often stayed up all night writing Ã¢â‚¬â€ he told his secretary, &quot;Grab your pen and take down this song. I just wrote the best song I've ever written Ã¢â‚¬â€ heck, I just wrote the best song that anybody's ever written!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe7e286facb78880bb2b90254e4b7d1edaeed56c","amp;dn":"I%27m+Dreaming+Of+A+White+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe7e286facb78880bb2b90254e4b7d1edaeed56c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,126,40,111,172,183,136,128,187,43,144,37,78,75,125,30,218,238,213,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
