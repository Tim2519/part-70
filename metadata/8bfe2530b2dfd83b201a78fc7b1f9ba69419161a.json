Down the road, the guys visit a family farm with a staggering stockpile of stuff. Meanwhile back at the warehouse, Gerry and Brooke make a mega sale and then install an oversize surprise on the roof of the shop.\n\nThere is a mix up of episode numbers. According to the History.ca channel MegaPick is episode #12. The last episode (UK2) was mislabeled as episode #12 and should have been #11. \n\n\nSorry to say that this is the last episode of Canadian Pickers.\nIt's sad to know that there will not be anymore episodes of this fine Canadian show since Shaw cancelled it.\nSpecial thanks to all the fine people that enjoyed this show as much as I did and seeded it well whenever I uploaded it.\n\nBeechyBoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bfe2530b2dfd83b201a78fc7b1f9ba69419161a","amp;dn":"Canadian+Pickers+S04e12.MegaPick.HQwebrip-BeechyBoy.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bfe2530b2dfd83b201a78fc7b1f9ba69419161a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,254,37,48,178,223,216,59,32,26,120,252,123,31,155,166,148,25,22,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
