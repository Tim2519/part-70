She recalls moving into a grotty student flat with Hannah in the mid-eighties. In those days Annie was self conscious and jumpy. The pair have not seen one another since graduation. They both now have moderately successful careers and are, at least on the surface, self assured in their new lives. However, they are still carrying a lot of emotional baggage from their university days. During the course of a weekend they rediscover their close friendship and encounter many faces from the past.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7e3891e1516ad47711dd8c3e1581303b4f635eb","amp;dn":"Career+Girls+1997+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7e3891e1516ad47711dd8c3e1581303b4f635eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,227,137,30,21,22,173,71,113,29,216,195,225,88,19,3,180,246,53,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
