The album is a tribute to legendary bluesman Robert Johnson. According to Clapton's autobiography, the recordings weren't intended to become an album. The band had rented the studio, but Clapton didn't have any songs written, so he suggested they record Robert Johnson songs. They recorded enough songs for an album and it was decided to release them as such.\n\nSee Also :-\n\nI'm uploading this next .. not sure if I can edit this and put the link ...\n\nSessions for Robert J is the 17th studio album by English rock guitarist and singer-songwriter Eric Clapton.In late 2004, a companion project, Sessions for Robert J, was released on CD/DVD. It features Clapton and the band performing additional takes of songs from Me and Mr. Johnson, as well as others not on the album, including &quot;From Four 'Til Late&quot;, &quot;Terraplane Blues&quot;, &quot;Ramblin' on my Mind&quot;, &quot;Sweet Home Chicago&quot;, and &quot;Stones in my Passway&quot;. Several songs are performed in duet by Clapton on acoustic guitar and Doyle Bramhall II on steel string acoustic and dobro guitars. Between sessions, Clapton discusses Johnson's profound influence on him and other musicians. One notable segment features Clapton performing in the 508 Park Avenue building (http://508park.org) in Dallas, Texas, that served as a makeshift studio in 1937 for Johnson to cut his legendary recordings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:841e7c19fe3b9a038c47ff9d8e4e2aa37be8cef0","amp;dn":"Me+and+Mr+Johnson+-+Eric+Clapton+-+Delta+Blues+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"841e7c19fe3b9a038c47ff9d8e4e2aa37be8cef0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,30,124,25,254,59,154,3,140,71,255,157,142,78,42,163,123,232,206,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
