When things go horribly wrong, he can only seek help from the very criminals he used to work for.\nMeanwhile, across the galaxy, a man called Delta-Six wakes up in a hospital with no memory. Without knowing where to turn or who to trust, he vows to escape before he loses his identity completely.\nAs fate brings these two closer together, we discover a world where life is cheap, identities are bought and sold, and a quest for redemption can change the fate of a whole galaxy.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\n\nAWARDS\n\nNominated for the 2010 IGF Student Showcase (as Boryokudan Rue) (Windows version)\n\nAGS Awards 2011: Won Best Gameplay, Best Original Story, Best Player Character, Best Background Art, Best Character Art and Best Sound Effects (Windows version)\n\nAggies 2011: Won Best Story, Best Setting (Reader's Choice), Best Independent Adventure (Windows version)\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.3+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0fdff14431919fad515570b80af3025931bebba","amp;dn":"Gemini+Rue+v1.1+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0fdff14431919fad515570b80af3025931bebba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,253,255,20,67,25,25,250,213,21,87,11,128,175,48,37,147,27,235,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
