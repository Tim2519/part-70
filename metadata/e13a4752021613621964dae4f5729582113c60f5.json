It packs\na few configuration settings that can\nbe handled by users of any level of\nexperience\n\nUnlike other similar apps which\nreturn the old Start menu and button\nthe side menu of StartIsBack is\ntransparent and highlights every new\nprogram in the list\n\nWhen it comes to functionality\nStartIsBack integrates some useful\nfeatures. For example, if you search\nthe computer for a new item, this is\ninstantly shown in the results area\n(if it was previously indexed by\nWindows)\n\nAs we have mentioned before\nStartIsBack comes with a multitude of\nconfiguration settings these concern\nthe Start menu items and behavior\n(e.g. display My Computer as a link\nhide Default Programs and Device and\nPrinters), appearance (e.g. disable\ntaskbar translucency, hide the Start\nbutton) and switching rules (e.g\nshow the desktop when logging onto\nthe PC, switch to the last used\napplication when clicking the Start\nscreen)\n\nOther options refer to uncluttering\nitems in the Start screen (by\nrenaming the Start screen to &quot;Apps&quot;\nand by keeping only the modern apps\nin that location), the advanced\nsystem commands menu (combine the\nStart button context menu with the\none of the Start screen) and Windows\ntweaks (e.g. store and display\nrecently opened programs)\nFurthermore, you can disable\nStartIsBack for the current user\n\nStartIsBack does not put a strain on\nthe computer's overall performance\nas it uses a pretty low amount of CPU\nand system memory. It is pretty\nresponsive to key strokes and mouse\ncommands. We have not encountered any\nissues throughout our testing\nStartIsBack did not hang, crash or\ndisplay error dialogs. Thanks to its\nintuitive yet rich features, the\napplication should please users of\nall skill levels\n\nURL: http://www.startisback.com\n\niNSTALL NOTES\n\n1.) Unpack\n\n2.) Import included .reg file to\nregistry (yes, this is very\nimportant to do before install)\n\n3.) Install\n\n4.) Enjoy\n\nNOTE: Crack is preinstalled","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e13a4752021613621964dae4f5729582113c60f5","amp;dn":"StartIsBackPlus.v1.0.5.MULTILINGUAL-CRD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e13a4752021613621964dae4f5729582113c60f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,58,71,82,2,22,19,98,25,100,218,228,245,114,149,130,17,60,96,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
