This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nTwo listeners ask the same question; &quot;What are the longest and shortest songs to ever hit the top 40?&quot; The shortest was barely more than a minute, and the longest was over eight minutes. Casey gives the long and short of it.\n\nThere is a hit in the countdown by a man who, when he was a boy, met Elvis and then traded his Whammo slingshot for a box of 45's.\n\nPeter Gabriel and Moving Pictures both have their first top 40 hits.\n\nThis chart is a good poker hand. It has three hearts in a row. &quot;Heartlight&quot; by Neil Diamond (at number 17), &quot;Heart Attack&quot; by Olivia Newton-John (at number 16), and &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; by Dionne Warwick (at number 15).\n\nThere is a song in the countdown inspired by scientific achievements such as measuring the Van Allen radiation belt, theorizing about glaciers, and noticing that the earth's crust is cracking. Casey gives the objective, empirical data.\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;How many foreign language songs have made the top 10?&quot; Casey says there have been 7 in the rock era, 3 of those made numero uno.\n\nLW#3:  Mickey - Toni Basil\nLW#2:  Gloria - Laura Branigan\nLW#1:  Truly - Lionel Richie\n40:    Love In Store - Fleetwood Mac\n39:    Shock The Monkey - Peter Gabriel\n38:    Let's Go Dancin' - Kool &amp; The Gang        \n37:    I Do - The J.
