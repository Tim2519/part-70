Unfortunately, in a town like Manson, she finds more suspects than allies. This issue begins a new story arc in Terry Moore's critically acclaimed series. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ab513a35e398908f3a2fcbcb7e360eaf4dd39d3","amp;dn":"Rachel+Rising+%281440+%2B+2028px%29+%282048px%29+%28TaruTariat-Novus-HD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ab513a35e398908f3a2fcbcb7e360eaf4dd39d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,181,19,163,94,57,137,8,243,162,252,188,183,227,96,234,244,221,57,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
