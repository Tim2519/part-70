This great and still underrated record was Ã¯Â¬ï¿½lled with varied, imaginative and cleverly-arranged songs based mostly on pleasant sax and Ã¯Â¬â€šute passages and was deÃ¯Â¬ï¿½nitely inÃ¯Â¬â€šuenced by late 60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s psychedelia and classic progressive bands like King Crimson, Van Der Graaf Generator and Jethro Tull. The central point of this very professionally produced album was Le Chateau Hante - progressive, mostly instrumental, 11 minutes track dominated by twisted sounds, haunting whispers and very long, fuzzed-out guitar solo. This CD edition has been carefully remastered from original, analogue source and sounds better than ever!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:590f66d48574772d49b6cf1c604416ee5a74cb56","amp;dn":"Champignons+-+Premiere+Capsule+%281972%2F2012%29+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"590f66d48574772d49b6cf1c604416ee5a74cb56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,15,102,212,133,116,119,45,73,182,207,28,96,68,22,238,90,116,203,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
