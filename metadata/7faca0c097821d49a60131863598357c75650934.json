This CD proves no exception. However, this one is countless times superior to the best of the first four.\n\nThe nominees for Record of the Year again prove to be the best of the best songs heard over the past year. Brandy and Monica's &quot;The Boy is Mine&quot; was a huge hit (When did you NOT hear it?) and Celine's &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; was, modestly, quite successful. The Goo Goo Dolls' &quot;Iris&quot; was a hit on the rock circuit and Madonna's &quot;Ray of Light&quot; was a smash for pop music. And &quot;You're Still the One&quot; became Shania Twain's country-pop crossover hit.\n\nIn the Best New Artist category, there were some surprises and some deservers. The Backstreet Boys were, indeed, a surprise nominee in this category, since they've been famous in Canada since 1996. Andrea Bocelli and the Dixie Chicks well deserve their nominations, since their respective songs &quot;Amor ti vieta&quot; and &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot; were highly enjoyable, extraordinary songs. The Fugees' Lauryn Hill scored a smash with her &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot; and one-hit-wonder Natalie Imbruglia was a, indeed, a wonder nevertheless, with her &quot;Torn&quot;.\n\nThree newcomers went against two returning hitmakers in the Best Male Pop Performance category. Eagle-Eye Cherry's &quot;Save Tonight&quot; is an exceptional song that was in major circulation on the airwaves. Brian McKnight and Shawn Mullins became famous with their respective &quot;Anytime&quot; and &quot;Lullaby&quot;. Eric Clapton's &quot;My Father's Eyes&quot; is a succulent upbeat-yet-sad hit and Sting's &quot;You Were Meant For Me&quot; is a beautiful, powerful ballad made famous by Gene Kelly in &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot;.\n\nThis is a high-quality CD that you definitely should not miss out on.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7faca0c097821d49a60131863598357c75650934","amp;dn":"Grammy+Nominees+1999+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+Best+Hits+1999","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7faca0c097821d49a60131863598357c75650934","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,172,160,192,151,130,29,73,166,1,49,134,53,152,53,124,117,101,9,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
