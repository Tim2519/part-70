Heller Wilson has found the key. From acclaimed writer Charles Soule (27, Strongman, Swamp Thing) comes a mathematical thriller about Chaos, Probability, and the race to stop a citywide disaster. In 1978, Dr. Spencer Brownfield saved New York City from itself, bringing the city back from the verge of collapse and ruin. And for thirty years, his small, unnoticed adjustments to the city's systems have kept the city afloat. Or so he claims to Heller Wilson, a young graduate student that Dr. Brownfield has chosen as his successor. But are Dr. Brownfield's claims about The Butterfly Effect and how his &quot;complexity math&quot; apply to the city's patterns of life real, or are they the ravings of a man broken by the death of his wife and daughter, desperate to find some kind of control over the world around him? Part sci-fi, part philosophical exploration, part thriller, STRANGE ATTRACTORS examines what you can control in your life and what you can't, and how important it is to recognize the difference.\n\nenjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e676a8dd1b5eb9031cc8a7148f6f85af45df7dbc","amp;dn":"Strange+Attractors+%282013%29+%28Digital%29+%28phillywilly-Empire%29+cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e676a8dd1b5eb9031cc8a7148f6f85af45df7dbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,118,168,221,27,94,185,3,28,200,167,20,143,111,133,175,69,223,125,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
