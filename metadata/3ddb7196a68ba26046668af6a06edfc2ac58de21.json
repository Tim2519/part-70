The documentary will highlight over two years of August Burns Red's continuous touring throughout an entire record cycle. The title Rescue &amp; Restore (Foreign &amp; Familiar Edition) pays homage to the vast fan-base that August Burns Red has built over the years with multiple world-wide tours in North America, Europe, Asia, South America, &amp; Australia. Rescue &amp; Restore marks August Burns RedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fifth proper album, fleshing out an impressive body of work that also includes a live full-length record Home, a collection of B-sides Lost Messengers: The Outtakes, and a 2012 holiday album, August Burns Red Presents: Sleddin' Hill, A Holiday Album, released over the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lauded decade-long career. Since launching out of Manheim, PA, the industrious outfit has successfully transitioned from shake-up-the-field upstarts to one of the biggest names worldwide in the genre. On stages across the U.S. to Dubai, Japan, Australia, and South America, from renowned festivals such as UKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Download Festival to the Vans Warped Tour, which they joined again in 2013 as a main stage act, August Burns Red have spent years taking their music and message directly to fans, and in the process have grown into one of the leading forces in the modern metal scene, a fact bolstered by their 1.5 million Facebook fans and more than half-million albums sold.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ddb7196a68ba26046668af6a06edfc2ac58de21","amp;dn":"August+Burns+Red+-+Foreign+and+Familiar+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ddb7196a68ba26046668af6a06edfc2ac58de21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,219,113,150,166,139,162,96,70,102,138,246,160,110,223,194,172,88,222,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
