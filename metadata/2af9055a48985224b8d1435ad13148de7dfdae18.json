And it does not appear to be a warning.\nSo please be careful, and enjoy.\n\n\n/Ubehage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2af9055a48985224b8d1435ad13148de7dfdae18","amp;dn":"FUBAR+Emergency+Destroyer+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2af9055a48985224b8d1435ad13148de7dfdae18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,249,5,90,72,152,82,36,184,209,67,90,209,49,72,222,125,253,174,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
