Using Rich Robinson's descending chord progressions as a base, the band grooves its way through a remarkably fresh-sounding collection of Faces-like rockers and ballads, tearing into the material with flair and confidence and really coming into its own as a top-notch rock &amp; roll outfit. But while the focus is undeniably on the band's musical chemistry, Southern Harmony also boasts a strong collection of songs, striking a perfect balance between the concise Shake Your Money Maker and their later, more jam-oriented records. While there aren't as many obvious singles as on their debut album, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion is the best expression of the Crowes' ability to take a classic, tried-and-true sound and make it their own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e570668d55761740734750a39078e59ac7baf541","amp;dn":"The+Black+Crowes+-+The+Southern+Harmony+and+Musical+Companion+%5B2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e570668d55761740734750a39078e59ac7baf541","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,112,102,141,85,118,23,64,115,71,80,163,144,120,229,154,199,186,245,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
