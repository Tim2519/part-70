The London-based singer gives us three new recordings: two covers, and one heartwarming single about hibernating in bed, kissing, and spending Christmas under the covers. Production on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Xmas in BedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Last ChristmasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ courtesy of Oren Yoel. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not listening to Christmas songs sung by pretty girls with British accents, your Christmas is kind of a fail. From Eliza:\n\nSince my album wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be coming out until next year I thought IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have a little fun and make a Christmas EP.\n\nTracks are:\n1. The Gift of Giving (cover)\n2. Xmas in Bed\n3. Last Christmas (cover)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65249e889ebbbba7aad59b20f7003127796b8041","amp;dn":"Eliza+Doolittle+-+Xmas+In+Bed+EP+%28Itunes+rip%29+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65249e889ebbbba7aad59b20f7003127796b8041","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,36,158,136,158,187,187,167,170,213,155,32,247,0,49,39,121,107,128,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
