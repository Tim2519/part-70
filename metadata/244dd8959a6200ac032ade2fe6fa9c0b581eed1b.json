Understandably, she never forgot him. Over a decade later, they rekindled their romance and marriedÃ¢â‚¬â€but then he fell asleep again, and all hell broke loose. Though heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a romantic and mild-mannered Englishman by day, Adam quickly morphs into the uproariously foul-mouthed, vegetarian-hating, wildlife-obsessed character beloved by millions as Sleep TalkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Man, and Karen has the audio tapes to prove it. Among AdamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest hits:\n\n* Ã¢â‚¬Å“Squid wrestling: all tentacles and no substance.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n* Ã¢â‚¬Å“Back off, Robin. Batman is my b*tch now.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n* Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you give me those puppy eyes. Put Ã¢â‚¬â„¢em back. Puppy needs them.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n* Ã¢â‚¬Å“The carrots are winning! Damn those parsnips and their stupid infighting.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n* Ã¢â‚¬Å“Flowers for the lovers, schnapps for the thinkers, death to the vegetarians.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n* Ã¢â‚¬Å“If that shark thinks itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming to bed for a cuddle, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got another thing coming.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThese gems and more are interspersed with the fantastic conversations Karen and Adam have when he wakes, in which he attempts to interpret for Sleep TalkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Man, and stories that recount how love can bloomÃ¢â‚¬â€even when your beloved is a nocturnal maniac. By turns crude and charming, DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Let the Midget Out of the Wardrobe is a hilariously candid journey into one manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dreamland.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:244dd8959a6200ac032ade2fe6fa9c0b581eed1b","amp;dn":"Sleep+Talkin%27+Man+-+Karen+Slavick+Lennard.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"244dd8959a6200ac032ade2fe6fa9c0b581eed1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,77,216,149,154,98,0,172,3,42,222,47,230,250,156,11,88,30,237,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
