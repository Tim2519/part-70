They really make the holiday season for me, reminding me of days long ago when, as a boy, we listened to music like this on the radio on cold December evenings.\n\nNo, these recordings were not made by the original Glenn Miller Orchestra but by recording studio bands comprised of members and vocalists from the Glenn Miller Orchestra about a dozen years ago.\n\nIf you have heard Larry O'Brien and The Glenn Miller Orchestra anytime during the past two decades he has been leading it, you know that this Glenn Miller Orchestra is first-rate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a889e79caaad0dc0fecdf39158f1f59fa0f445ac","amp;dn":"The+Glenn+Miller+Orchestra+-+In+the+Christmas+Mood+Volume+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a889e79caaad0dc0fecdf39158f1f59fa0f445ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,137,231,156,170,173,13,192,254,205,243,145,88,241,245,159,160,244,69,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
