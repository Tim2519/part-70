The film opens with Pierre getting worked over by an irate pimp because he didn't pay for a hooker's drink. Rakish Irishman Tom offers to drive bloodied Pierre back to his seedy hotel. The following day, he stumbles upon Tom's sandwich bar and begs for a job. Though he describes himself as a dead-broke author working on a novel, Pierre is concealing secrets from his dark past. Later, during a party populated with well-turned out lesbians, Tom reveals that he moonlights as a gigolo and suggests that Pierre might try the same. Soon Pierre is making easy money at the same agency where Tom works. Things get complicated for our Gallic protagonist when he falls for a golden-hearted streetwalker with a psychotic ex-boyfriend and one of his married regulars falls for him. Told with wry wit and gritty honesty, this film explores London's dark sexual netherworld. ~ Jonathan Crow, Allrovi\n\nGroup/Ripper: Galmuchet\nVideo Format: AVI/MPEG-4 Visual\nVideo Bitrate: 1041 Kbps\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\nAspect Ratio: 1.860:1\nResolution: 640 x 344\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.189\nAudio Format: MPEG Audio\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps\nSampling rate: 48000 Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9179ddc96d78d377c6c107e4ed5cfd1f5601238","amp;dn":"Mauvaise+Passe+%281999%29.DVDRip.sub.eng.Galmuchet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9179ddc96d78d377c6c107e4ed5cfd1f5601238","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,23,157,220,150,215,141,55,124,108,16,126,78,213,207,209,245,96,18,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
