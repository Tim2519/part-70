Alongside their sole 45, this CD for the very first time offers a dozen recordings from a 'lost album' the band made during 1967/68. NGC 4594 formed in Storrs, Connecticut, but swiftly relocated to NYC before eventually disbanding in late 1968. For fans of West Coast-influenced Psychedelic music. Sleeve-notes by Tune In's Gray Newell tells the story of NGC 4594 for the very first time!\n\nFormed in Storrs, Connecticut in 1967, they chose a truly astronomical moniker in their search for stardom (NGC-4594 being otherwise known as the 'Sombrero' galaxy). Their 45 features very pleasant psychy soft-rock with the odd jazzy feel. Going Home is the more commercial, slightly more upbeat. Skipping is the gem here with its mellowed-out aura and trilling flute - somewhere between Boston's Freeborne and UK's Caravan. Delightful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59f9c69989105e64d72ea2998a55cadd320d0bfa","amp;dn":"NGC+4594...Skipping+Through+the+Night%282010%29%5BEAC%2CLOG%2CCUE%2CFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59f9c69989105e64d72ea2998a55cadd320d0bfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,249,198,153,137,16,94,100,215,46,162,153,138,85,202,221,50,13,11,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
