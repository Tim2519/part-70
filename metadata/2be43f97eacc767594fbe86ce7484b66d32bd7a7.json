When his beautiful girlfriend, Lena, is brutally and sadistically slain his life is turned upside down. In his search for her killers, he becomes hunter and hunted, exacting revenge whilst trying to stay alive. His quest turns into a bloody rites of passage, which takes him from London to the Midlands, to the hills of south Wales, and, ultimately, to Amsterdam, where the savage climax of the book is played out amidst the seedy back alleys of the red light district. &quot;Dead Pretty&quot; is fast moving, full of dramatic set pieces, a murderous journey with a twist in its tail. Mark Richards finds out more than he ever wanted to know, old demons rear up again in his mind, and he has to reach deep into his soul to survive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2be43f97eacc767594fbe86ce7484b66d32bd7a7","amp;dn":"Dead+Pretty+-+Roger+Granelli.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2be43f97eacc767594fbe86ce7484b66d32bd7a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,228,63,151,234,204,118,117,148,251,232,108,231,72,75,102,211,43,215,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
