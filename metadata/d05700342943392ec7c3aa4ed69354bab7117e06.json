Being a king, having been reared amidst the Germanic mythology of giants and dragons sky-riding Valkyries, he had the opportunity to carry out his fantasies. And so he created his own precursor of Disneyland, bankrupting the monarchy. This program tells the story of a mad king whose fantasies embodied many of the concepts that, half a century after his death in 1886, led another madman who loved to dream in the Bavarian Alps, to bring Germany to the brink of destruction.
