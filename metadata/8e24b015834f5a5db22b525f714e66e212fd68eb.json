We serve an ethical God. Moral rightness flows from His being. His ways are in accord with His unchangeable character. In short, God is absolutely perfect and His moral law is a reflection of His holy character (Psalm 19:7). More than that, He has shown man what is good and what is required of him (Micah 6:8). We all must learn the way of the Lord and instruct our growing children in it.\nAs was the case with the previous editions, this curriculum is not intended to give all the answers or provide the reader with all he or she will ever need to know about the process of raising a child. Therefore, parents guided by their own convictions have the ultimate responsibility and duty to research parenting philosophies available today and then make an informed decision as to what is best for their family. Growing Kids GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Way is just one resource out of many available to guide parents along the way.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e24b015834f5a5db22b525f714e66e212fd68eb","amp;dn":"Growing+Kids+God%27s+Way+-+3+Videos+and+mp3s+%2B+Pdf+Workbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e24b015834f5a5db22b525f714e66e212fd68eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,36,176,21,131,79,90,93,178,43,82,95,113,78,102,226,18,253,104,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
