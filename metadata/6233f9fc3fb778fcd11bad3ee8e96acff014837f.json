Siena can't escape. She's trapped now. How did she fall so helplessly, recklessly in love with the one man who could single handedly turn her life upside down? Harrison has her wrapped up in his strong, muscular, tattooed arms. Right where he wants her. Right where she wants to be. Even as the championship is decided and fate comes crashing down around themÃ¢â‚¬â€betrayal, blackmail, death...all seem like nothing compared to Siena's ultimate secret.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6233f9fc3fb778fcd11bad3ee8e96acff014837f","amp;dn":"Masters+Colleen-Faster+Longer+LittleFairyRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6233f9fc3fb778fcd11bad3ee8e96acff014837f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,51,249,252,63,183,120,252,209,27,173,62,232,233,106,207,240,20,131,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
