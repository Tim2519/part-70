Its prime audience will probably be indie rock listeners, but in some senses there's little rock on the record, as there's almost nothing in the way of guitar and absolutely no bass or drums. Instead, the arrangements emphasize chamber music-like strings and the multi-instrumental talents of Dommisse, who alone plays electric cello, Wurlitzer electric piano, omnichord, vibraphone, and synths. The songs are pensive, somewhat dark, and delicate, and while this isn't exactly goth, references to death in no less than four of the ten song titles certainly add to the somber and cloudy atmosphere. It's a bit like hearing a musical theater piece dedicated to an isolated Central European community overrun by loss and melancholy. For some listeners, Dommisse's quite high and wavering voice might be a weak link, though fans of the likes of Joanna Newsom might well view its idiosyncrasy as an asset...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6734651c8236fc3e21310dcc036390e426786cb","amp;dn":"Orion+Rigel+Dommisse+-+What+I+Want+From+You+Is+Sweet+%5B2007%5D%5BEAC.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6734651c8236fc3e21310dcc036390e426786cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,115,70,81,200,35,111,195,226,19,16,220,192,54,57,14,66,103,134,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
