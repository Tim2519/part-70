In the year 2006 the kid brothers [Mutta] and [Hibito], on a nightly hunt for animal sounds in the local woods, unexpectedly see a blazingly bright rotating flying object in the sky, right above their home town. After a short moment the UFO accelerates towards the surface of the Moon. Witnessing this, the two youngsters vow to become astronauts and some day travel into space. Now in 2025 younger brother Hibito, as the first Japanese, made it into the NASA team that will set foot on the Moon again. Mutta, on the other hand, defending his brothers honour, gets fired from his car designer job. The older of the two brothers has not forgotten about their dream from back then though... and on a fateful day his life changes.
