On 1 September 2013, it debuted at No. 6 in the UK Albums Chart and at No. 1 on the UK Indie Chart.\n\nBackground and recording:\n\nThe band previewed many of their new tracks at live performances over 2012 and 2013. The album was recorded during 2013 at Alex Kapranos' Scottish studio and Nick McCarthy's Sausage Studios in London. Kapranos described the album direction as &quot;forward&quot; and revealed that the band decided to keep a low profile about things as their last album was &quot;tainted&quot; by misinformation prior to its release. Kapranos said that the album deals with &quot;the idea of the cynic's search for optimism and the sceptic's search for a manual crop up here and there. I've always liked the lead character in Alasdair Gray's Lanark growing the hard scales to defend the soft inner-self from the world. Socially awkward asthmatic with a self-consuming imagination. My 19-year-old self was electrified. Maybe the album is about how to shed those scales.&quot;\n\nMusic videos:\n\nThe &quot;Right Action&quot; official video was released on 7 July 2013, directed by Jonas Odell, and the video for &quot;Love Illumination&quot; was released on 24 July 2013, directed by Tim Saccenti. As of 30 August, both videos have received over 1 million YouTube views. The &quot;Evil Eye&quot; official music video was released on 8 September 2013 and was directed by Diane Martel, who is known for directing videos for various Top 3 hits such as &quot;Blurred Lines&quot;, &quot;Just Give Me a Reason&quot;, &quot;We Can't Stop&quot;, and one of the bands' hit singles, &quot;Do You Want To&quot;. The band released the official video for &quot;Bullet&quot; on 18 November 2013 and was directed by Andy Knowles.\n\n\nFranz Ferdinand are an indie rock band formed in 2002, and based in Glasgow, Scotland.
