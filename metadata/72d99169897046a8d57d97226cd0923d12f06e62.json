I found them online and combined them all into single pdf file. It's not a scan, so the pages don't match the pagination of the print volumes. Also, Ken's introduction is missing. Otherwise I believe it's all there.\n\nThis isn't a beginner's book on ACIM. But for committed Course students, it's a goldmine.\n\n\ndescription (refers to print edition):\n\nThis eight-volume set is the product of a series of 58 classes conducted at our Foundation's former location in New York. The classes consisted of a line-by-line analysis of the lessons, introductions, reviews, summaries, and the Epilogue. The original discussion has been enlarged considerably, and many additional references included to other relevant portions of the Course, the Preface, the two pamphlets, poems from The Gifts of God, and the prose poem &quot;The Gifts of God.&quot; This work can thus be seen as a complete Course companion to accompany students on their own journey through the workbook.\n\n----\n\nSee this for the Course itself:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8178909&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8178909&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThere are a number of audio lectures by Ken Wapnick on tpb, for example:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7609725&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7609725&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd user storm45 has uploaded several ACIM-related books that are easy miss:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/storm45/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/storm45/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72d99169897046a8d57d97226cd0923d12f06e62","amp;dn":"Ken+Wapnick+-+A+Course+in+Miracles+Workbook+Commentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72d99169897046a8d57d97226cd0923d12f06e62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,217,145,105,137,112,70,168,213,125,151,34,108,208,146,61,18,240,110,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
