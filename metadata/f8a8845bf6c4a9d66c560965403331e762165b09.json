Featuring lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard, &quot;Even Flow&quot; was released in 1992 as the second single from the band's debut album, Ten (1991). The song peaked at number three on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The song was included on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2003). A remixed version of the song was included on the 2009 Ten reissue.\n\nOriginal video:\n\nPearl Jam originally hired director Rocky Schenck to film a music video for &quot;Even Flow&quot;. On January 31, 1992, on their way to England to begin a European tour, the band members came to Los Angeles, California to film the video. The concept for the video was based on an idea by Gossard. Schenck filmed Pearl Jam in a zoo setting. He had arranged a nighttime shoot at an old, closed facility, brought in different wildlife, and set up his lights among the cages and in the trees. Along with the animal footage, the members of Pearl Jam were filmed individually and as a band, standing on the side of a cliff and air jamming. The shoot took hours, and the band was not pleased with the end result. Schenck's shoot was considered a waste of time and money by the band; it also damaged Abbruzzese's wrists significantly. After shooting had finished, he was taken to the emergency room where he was advised not to put strain on his wrists. Abbruzzese would drum on the band's European tour with a splint attached to his hands.\n\nOfficial video:\n\nThe original music video for &quot;Even Flow&quot; was ultimately replaced by a performance clip directed by Josh Taft, who had previously directed the &quot;Alive&quot; music video for the band, and who would later direct the music video for &quot;Oceans&quot;. The video consists of performance footage of the band filmed during a January 17, 1992 show at the Moore Theatre in Seattle, Washington. Taft was filming that night not in his capacity as a director, but as a friend of Gossard's. (At one point during the show, Vedder had even stopped the proceedings, clearly of the opinion that Taft's presence was intrusive. &quot;This is not a TV studio, Josh&quot; he'd yelled indignantly, in an interlude that Taft left in his final cut but that MTV clipped out of most versions it aired. &quot;Turn those lights out, it's a fucking rock concert!&quot;) The video shows Vedder climbing the theatre, and then jumping down between fans at the concert and ending with Gossard throwing his guitar towards the camera.\n\nThe footage used in the video is actually spliced from different songs: for instance Gossard and McCready each play two different guitars, Vedder wears a hat at some point and the theatre climb actually occurred during &quot;Porch&quot;. Taft's presence at the Moore Theatre show, and the fact that he had filmed sufficient footage to compile into a music video, proved to be a break for the band. Otherwise with Epic ready to provide MTV with an &quot;Even Flow&quot; video and Schenck's version already completed, Pearl Jam would have had little choice but to go with it, and the band members unanimously despised Schenck's version when they saw the final edit. The alternate studio recording of &quot;Even Flow&quot;, which was recorded in 1992 with Abbruzzese, was used for the video as the band felt it synched up well with the live footage. The video was released in April 1992.\n\nPearl Jam is an American rock band that formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1990. Since its inception, the band's line-up has included Stone Gossard (guitar), Jeff Ament (bass), Mike McCready (guitar), and Eddie Vedder (vocals). The band's fifth and current drummer is Matt Cameron, of Soundgarden, who has been with the band since 1998.\n\nFormed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, Ten, in 1991. One of the key bands of the grunge movement in the early 1990s, over the course of the band's career, its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make music videos, giving interviews and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having &quot;spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.&quot;\n\nTo date, the band has sold over 31.5 million records in the U.S, and an estimated 60 million worldwide. Pearl Jam has outlasted and outsold many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of the decade. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to Pearl Jam as &quot;the most popular American rock &amp; roll band of the '90s.&quot;\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_Flow&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_Flow&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaenOaafd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaenOaafd&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Duration: 00:05:26\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
