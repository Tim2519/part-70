Yet this period was quite significant, for it marks the crest of B.B. King's initial entry into the pop music mass market -- and this album surfs succinctly, if not comprehensively, over the high points of his turn-of-the-decade winning streak. There's a potent slice of King's triumphant Live at Cook County -- one of his sassiest &quot;How Blue Can You Get?&quot; on records -- the huge hit &quot;The Thrill Is Gone&quot; extracts from his surprisingly pleasing early excursions into pop/rock territory on In London and Indianola Mississippi Seeds, and plenty of flavorful electric blues (&quot;Sweet Sixteen,&quot; &quot;Why I Sing the Blues&quot;) at full length. There are some quirks -- &quot;Caldonia&quot; is shortened because one of the unnamed participants on the session demanded the cut, and the &quot;compatible stereo/quad&quot; sound on the LP has some details drastically mixed down when it's played back in ordinary stereo. Most curious of all is the last track, where King plunks out &quot;Nobody Loves Me But My Mother&quot; on a tack piano and then his closing words are converted into a weird, gradually slowed-down, echotized electronic blur that settles into a creepy locked-end groove.\nAll Music Review by Richard S.
