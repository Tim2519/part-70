Time is pitifully short, ammunition is low.\n\nThe only things in abundance are the slobbering, bloodthirsty masses swarming across the planet of the living dead!\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - The Last Zombie - The End (#001-005):\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9251016&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9251016&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Music)] - Lazerhawk - Skull and Shark (2013) [320 kbbs]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9284501&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9284501&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n** If you have any questions please feel free to ask! **","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a4d94267471d7d0432907ae4ec45741dd6bd4d9","amp;dn":"Planet+of+the+Living+Dead+%28%23001-004%29+%7C+%28Joseph+Wight%29+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a4d94267471d7d0432907ae4ec45741dd6bd4d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,77,148,38,116,113,215,208,67,41,7,174,78,196,87,65,221,107,212,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
