Well then you would expect Rand to be all for it! Rand Paul has always been about Ã¢â‚¬Å“disserviceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to black people... if private businesses like restaurants prefer to give black people Ã¢â‚¬Å“disserviceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ instead of service. Paul was asked about extending unemployment compensation because the black unemployment rate is still over 12 percent. In fairness to Rand Paul, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure he really doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like seeing anyone of any race ever getting any unemployment relief ever.\n\nNewt Gingrich says he was very surprised at the vicious backlash he got from the base for praising Nelson Mandela. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how freaky the GOP base has gottenÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crazy enough to out-crazy the guy who wants to turn black kids into unpaid janitors! One person responded to NewtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s praise of Mandela by writing Ã¢â‚¬Å“This clenched-fist, murdering, gorilla warrior does not deserve respect from informed Americans.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And yes, they spelled Ã¢â‚¬Å“gorillaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the way you do for an ape, not a fighter. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“gorilla warriorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ post is a tough one. You really canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tell if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the result of vicious racism or incredible ignorance. The Republican base has plenty of both.\n\nIn South Carolina, a county sheriff is refusing to honor President ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s order that flags be flown at half-staff for Nelson Mandela. Come on, South Carolina! We mean the American flag, not the Confederate flag you still fly in the state capitol. Pickens County Sheriff Rick Clark (does that sound like a character in a movie or what?) said he wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lower the flag because Mandela Ã¢â‚¬Å“was not an American.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It may also because he was not white... but then in South Carolina, Ã¢â‚¬Å“whiteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“AmericanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tend to get conflated.\n\nSarah Palin is out on the talk circuit hyping the phony Ã¢â‚¬Å“War on Christmas.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hey, the woman has a Christmas-themed book to sell. Ã¢â‚¬ËœTis the season. This is all about selling books. If there really is a war on Christmas, then that would make Sarah Palin a war profiteer. Sarah says there is plot to Ã¢â‚¬Å“abort Christ from ChristmasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Ã¢â‚¬Å“angry atheists armed with an attorney.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Congratulations, SarahÃ¢â‚¬â€youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re now nothing but Ann Coulter... with alliteration!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4888f171e1c35982ff00fc87d72ba6151456d6f","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+December+09+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4888f171e1c35982ff00fc87d72ba6151456d6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,136,143,23,30,28,53,152,47,240,15,200,125,114,186,97,81,69,109,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
