Skilled filmmakers and performers carefully craft practically every facet of the film, from the exceptional camera work and performances to the editing and music. The story is certainly offbeat Ã¢â‚¬â€ some viewers may quibble with the religious message, though it merits careful consideration as to how seamlessly such themes are integrated into the pervasively downbeat noir framework. Studio pictures from this era are typically derivative and almost wholly unoriginal, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite refreshing to discover a film that takes the trappings of film noir and applies them in a unique way.\n\ncalvinnme from United States 30 May 2011\n... because you always know what you're going to get. However, that doesn't mean that I don't really enjoy his movies. Nobody, I mean nobody does revenge like Raft. Here he plays businessman Johnny Torno, proud older brother of young Jess Torno, a priest recently returned from being a chaplain in WWII. Four years earlier Torno's bookkeeper Nick Cherney (Raymond Burr) was sent to prison for embezzling from Johnny's company - he was embarrassingly guilty and it was really a lot of money. Instead of blaming the man in the mirror, Nick blames Johnny for his fate and crafts a particularly cruel revenge. If he kills Johnny, Johnny's troubles are over. However, if he kills what is precious to him - brother Jess - he can plunge Johnny into a living hell of grief. He sends a hit man (Harry Morgan) out to do the killing. Johnny finds Jess just before he dies. Of course Johnny wants to know who did this so he can kill them in revenge - he tells Jess so - and Jess tells him the answer is written in a Bible.\n\nNow at first Johnny thinks Jess means his own personal Bible, but after searching through it he finds nothing. He then realizes that Jess probably meant the Gideon Bible that is found in every hotel room. This starts Johnny on a search for the missing Bible and all of the guests in the hotel room since Jess' death who might have taken it. Nick, now out of prison, along with the hit man, are right on Johnny's heels hoping their plans are not discovered.\n\nIt is very odd to see later TV good guys Harry Morgan and Raymond Burr playing such sinister characters but the performances ring true. So does Virginia Mayo as a girl Johnny befriends along the way as the voice of reason and even redemption. Raft wrestles here not only with bad guys and a mystery but with God Himself - he treats the Almighty either like a traffic cop that he thinks can be bribed or an unreliable employee that he doesn't fire because he enjoys blaming him for his troubles, depending on his mood.\n\nA good noir and good stuff from Raft - highly recommended.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 531mb\nDuration.... 01:23:20\nCodec....... avc1\nFrame Width.... 720\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate.... 773kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 112kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48 KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c812521fab95820f159e65d55d364c5e7f2eb720","amp;dn":"Red+Light+1949+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c812521fab95820f159e65d55d364c5e7f2eb720","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,18,82,31,171,149,130,15,21,158,101,213,93,54,76,94,127,46,183,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
