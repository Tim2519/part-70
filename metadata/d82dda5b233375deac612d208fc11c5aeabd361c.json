I've never known anyone to hear one noise group and instantly fall in love with the genre. Phil Blankenship's noise project is out to make that fact doubly true. Night of the Bloody Tapes is noise for noise extremists. Its fuzzed out, unrelenting, damaged presentation is confrontational and angry. The attack simply never stops on this record. \n\nThe Cherry Points work with Yellow Swans was loud as hell, but lacked the confrontational edge Blankenship has molded on his latest full-length. For over forty minutes a steady stream of feedback, white noise, and the sounds of fire turned up to ear-bleeding levels pours through the speakers. It isn't lazy noise, it's noise bound and determined to tear some things to shreds, to remove limbs from bodies, and to generally wreak havoc. The cover art and accompanying stickers suggest Blankenship is trying to fuse some B-movie horror with his noise, but I can't imagine this noise as a soundtrack to anything but an orgy of blood.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d82dda5b233375deac612d208fc11c5aeabd361c","amp;dn":"Night+of+the+Bloody+Tapes+-+Cherry+Point+%5B2005%5D+-+Lossy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d82dda5b233375deac612d208fc11c5aeabd361c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,45,218,91,35,51,117,222,172,97,45,32,143,193,28,90,234,189,54,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
