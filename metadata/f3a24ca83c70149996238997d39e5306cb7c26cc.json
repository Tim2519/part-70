Sam Cooke could sing anything and make it work. But when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re talking about his strength as a \nsinger, range is not relevant. It was his power to deliver Ã¢â‚¬â€ it was about his phrasing, the totality of his singing,&quot; \nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Van Morrison, for Rolling Stone magazineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 100 Greatest Singers Of All Time, ranking Cooke at No. 4\nThis Best Of Sam Cooke album was the beacon that kept CookeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular songs in the public eye. Between 1957 and his death \nseven years later, Cooke recorded an average of one Top Ten single every four months! And now on this single LP, you \ncan relive the timeless best known and best-loved Sam Cooke classics.\nSo good, in fact, was Cooke as a vocalist that Atlantic Records vice president Jerry Wexler said matter-of-factly,\n Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sam Cooke was the best singer who ever lived, no contest.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But beyond just his voice, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the phrasing that makes these songs\n so timeless and memorable. Cooke himself explained it this way: Ã¢â‚¬Å“You just talk the story. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how you get people to come \nto you Ã¢â‚¬â€œ because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not like a song, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like two people rapping, only with a melody attached. But then when you come to the\n hook (Ã¢â‚¬ËœThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the sound of the men working on the chain gangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), then youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re free, everybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gonna sing that part, you want to\n get everybody to sing along.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still singing along.\n\n=====================================\n\nTracklist\n\n  \t\t\nA1 - You Send Me.flac \t54.7 MB\nA2 - Only Sixteen.flac \t43.48 MB\nA3 - Everybody Loves to Cha Cha Cha.flac \t57.71 MB\nB1 - (I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons.flac \t55.71 MB\nB2 - (What a) Wonderful World.flac \t46.7 MB\nB3 - Summertime.flac \t48.17 MB\nC1 - Chain Gang.flac \t54.66 MB\nC2 - Cupid.flac \t55.13 MB\nC3 - Twistin' the Night Away.flac \t57.49 MB\nC4 - Sad Mood.flac \t53.17 MB\nD1 - Having a Party.flac \t54.82 MB\nD2 - Bring It On Home to Me.flac \t57.54 MB\nD3 - Another Saturday Night (alternate take).flac\n\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size : 700 MiB\nAlbum : The Best of Sam Cooke\nTrack name/Total : 13\nPerformer : Sam Cooke\nGenre : Soul / R'n'B\nDescription : Analogue Productions 45rpm 180g 2xLP-Set; Mastered by Kevin Gray @ CoHearent Audio, LA\nRecorded date : 1962\n\n==============================\n\nAudio\n\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 2991 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 96 KHz\nBit depth : 24 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3a24ca83c70149996238997d39e5306cb7c26cc","amp;dn":"Sam+Cooke+-+The+Best+of+Sam+Cooke+%281962%29+Flac%5B24Bit+96KHz+Vinyl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3a24ca83c70149996238997d39e5306cb7c26cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,162,76,168,60,112,20,153,150,35,137,151,211,158,83,6,203,124,38,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
