The film, which tells the story of Our Lady, begins with original sin. Through the stages of her earthly life - Annunciation, visit to St. Elizabeth, birth of Jesus, flight to Egypt, childhood and public life of Jesus, Calvary, Resurrection - we reach her death and Assumption into Heaven. Several episodes follow to demonstate that Our Lady is the natural mediatrix between the Creator and the creatures; as well as a review of the major Marian sanctuaries.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4bdaeceb61d102aba296daece18d5e05f4b9fb7","amp;dn":"Mater+Dei+%281950%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4bdaeceb61d102aba296daece18d5e05f4b9fb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,189,174,206,182,29,16,42,186,41,109,174,206,24,213,224,95,75,159,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
