The pressure is on law enforcement officials to stop the viscously calculated killer(s), and to do it quickly. An elite, yet experimental F.B.I. unit, formed specifically to investigate high profile crimes, is called in to head the investigation. Under the leadership of Special Agent Gabriel Santana, this F.B.I. team matches its investigators with hardened criminals who are currently incarcerated for having committed crimes similar in nature to the case they are trying to solve. In this particular instance, it means working with a racist-militia leader serving a life sentence, a man that would rather help the murderer(s) than see the killing-spree stop.\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d54953e800d86d59cd7267ba6a4ab053cbabc6d6","amp;dn":"25+To+Life+%282010%29+%28Digital%29+%28Darkness-Empire%29cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d54953e800d86d59cd7267ba6a4ab053cbabc6d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,73,83,232,0,216,109,89,205,114,103,186,106,74,176,83,203,171,198,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
