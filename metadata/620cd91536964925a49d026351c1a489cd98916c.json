His masterpiece: BLUE SERGE LP(Disc IV).\n\n\n\nI've condensed Discs I and II master takes onto a single 80 minute CDR for your\n\nburrrning convenience.  Use &quot;CDBurnerXP&quot; drag and drop if burrrn ever fails you.\n\n\n\nFull MOSAIC booklet included however it's the same low quality you may have\n\ncome to expect here.  I have prioritized listening pleasure over analysis.\n\n\n\nThis music will delight even half-hearted fans of bebop.\n\n\n\nProceed directly to Disc III: BODY AND SOUL (trk #5)  to get an idea of Serge's\n\ngenius on bari-sax.\n\n\n\n\nHAPPY SHORT DAYS TO ALL!  (northern hemisphere only)   HAPPY LONG DAYS ELSEWHERE!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:620cd91536964925a49d026351c1a489cd98916c","amp;dn":"SERGE+CHALOFF+++++%281946-1956%29+++++MOSAIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"620cd91536964925a49d026351c1a489cd98916c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,12,217,21,54,150,73,37,164,157,2,99,81,193,164,137,205,152,145,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
