To what purpose, it's inappropriate for a proper young lady even \n   to contemplate.

Hilarity (and swashbuckling) ensues.\n\nIf you've read Naifeh's &quot;Courtney Crumrin&quot;, you now know what to expect, because this is EXACTLY how one would naively imagine that particular author to tackle this particular concept. Even the ships (see above) look just like Crumrin House!\n\nAnd if you've not read &quot;Courtney Crumrin&quot;... do so ( &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9206290&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9206290&lt;/a&gt;  ), and forget about this one for now, would be my advice.\n\n---\n\n   Single volume compiled from DCP's traditional scans of the six-part series.\n   Quality varies a bit from issue to issue, but is quite acceptable overall.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5cc55d785958cdda76d51c3e279a5e5616bd14a","amp;dn":"Ted+Naifeh%3A+Polly+and+the+Pirates+%28Oni%29+%282005%29+%28Team-DCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5cc55d785958cdda76d51c3e279a5e5616bd14a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,204,85,215,133,149,140,221,167,109,81,195,226,121,165,229,97,107,209,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
