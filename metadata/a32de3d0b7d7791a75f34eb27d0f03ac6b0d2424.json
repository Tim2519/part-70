It was originally released in 1968. The recording was made before Otis Redding attained\n crossover fame at the Monterey Pop Festival.\nThis album, released posthumously, captured Otis Redding's show at the Whisky A Go Go from April of 1966 in Los Angeles.\n What is essential here was that it captured Otis Redding's sound in a small club with his own touring band, as opposed to his\n work on stage with Booker T. &amp; the MG's -- an ideal band, to be sure, which is why they were sent over to Europe with him and\n why they were at Monterey with him a year later, but not the group that Redding normally worked on stage with. This album is \ncloser to how Otis Redding sounded in the years coming up and working his way to the top, and the way that his original audience\n on the chitlin' circuit heard him.\n\n==========================================\n\nTracklist\n\n1\tI Can't Turn You Loose\t2:35\n2\tPain in My Heart\t2:14\n3\tJust One More Day\t5:26\n4\tMr. Pitiful\t2:07\n5\t(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\t4:38\n6\tI'm Depending on You\t3:02\n7\tAny Ole Way\t2:39\n8\tThese Arms of Mine\t4:01\n9\tPapa's Got a Brand New Bag\t4:46\n10\tRespect\t2:05\n\n============================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 731 MiB\nAlbum                                    : In Person At The Whisky A Go Go\nTrack name/Total                         : 10\nPerformer                                : Otis Redding\nComposer                                 : Otis Redding\nProducer                                 : Atlantic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ P-6142A (Japanese pressing 1968)\nGenre                                    : Soul\nDescription                              : 24-bit / 96kHz Vinyl Rip by Garybx (September 2011)\nRecorded date                            : 1968\n\n\nAudio\n\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 2 595 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a32de3d0b7d7791a75f34eb27d0f03ac6b0d2424","amp;dn":"Otis+Redding+-+In+Person+At+The+Whisky+A+Go+Go+%281968%29+Flac%5B24+Bi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a32de3d0b7d7791a75f34eb27d0f03ac6b0d2424","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,45,227,208,183,215,121,26,117,243,78,178,125,15,3,172,107,13,36,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
