Fujita is an art dealer &amp; restorer, who runs the mysterious Gallery Fake which though somewhat cheesy on the outside just exhibiting fake paintings, it is rumoured to be a front to move real paintings around at extraordinary prices.\n\nThis is an excellent anime that took me many years to fully download, and I've included a folder with the original .TORRENTS in it. It may sound boring by the description, but it can be quite action packed. It reminds me of old movies, and how Fujita is more a film noir hero. Some of the adventures they get into is exposing corruption, restoring a painting while on an aeroplane (ÃƒÂ  la Trauma Center), dealing with mobsters, looking for El Dorado's treasure, dealing with a woman who has a clock fetish, unlimited rice pudding, et cetera, et cetera.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:983818fd71a2e37cf66539b362fdf7437ecf38b0","amp;dn":"Gallery+Fake+%5Bcomplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"983818fd71a2e37cf66539b362fdf7437ecf38b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,56,24,253,113,162,227,124,246,101,57,179,98,253,247,67,126,207,56,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
