It was established in 1929 and the current editor-in-chief is Gene D. Sprouse. The journal publishes review articles on all aspects of physics.\n\nRMP brings the broad fundamental physics literature in established topical areas together and places it within the context of current trends in research and applications. Its review articles offer in-depth treatment of a research area, surveying recent work, and providing an introduction aimed at graduate students and nonspecialists. The journal's shorter Colloquia describe recent work of interest to all, especially work at the frontiers of physics, which may impact several different subfields.\n\nThis ISO File contains all the papers published between 1984-2008 along with an user-friendly interface.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3432bc144ffd2a4d3007a1ad5c5c2fd20a72039","amp;dn":"APS-+Reviews+of+Modern+Physics+1984-2008++ISO+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3432bc144ffd2a4d3007a1ad5c5c2fd20a72039","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,67,43,193,68,255,210,164,211,0,122,26,213,197,194,253,32,167,32,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
