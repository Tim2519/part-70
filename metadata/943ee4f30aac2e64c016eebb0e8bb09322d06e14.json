But trouble isn't ready to let go of Poke. Enter the one person Poke least wants to see in the entire worldÃ¢â‚¬â€a person whose emotional hold on Poke is absolute. With him come a box of rubies, a wad of fraudulent identity papers, andÃ¢â‚¬â€in pursuit of those thingsÃ¢â‚¬â€one of the most dangerous gangsters in China.\n\nAdd to that Rose's innocent involvement in a North Korean counterfeiting operation and an off-the-tracks agent of the American Secret Service who's dying to put Poke behind bars, and Poke and his family find themselves in a complicated and potentially deadly situation.
