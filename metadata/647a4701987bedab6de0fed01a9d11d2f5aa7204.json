From a rational viewpoint based in scientific materialism and realism, it seeks to decode and illuminate some of the ancient secrets of yoga into a very readable and fun package.\n\nThe book also closely examines the unconscious symbolism of Kundalini and the chakras as it relates to personal development and progress in meditation, and describes some highly effective techniques for generating yoga trances and meditative ecstasy; it also features a very clear-eyed discussion of sexual yoga and describes some genuine sexual yoga techniques that can be easily learned and effectively applied.
