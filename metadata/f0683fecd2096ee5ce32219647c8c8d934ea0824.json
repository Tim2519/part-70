There are 117 passages taken from the first five books of Moses pointing to the Messiah in that. The second part is a reference to the Writings (Ketuvim). There are 144 passages taken pointing to Christ in that section. The third part refers to the Prophets (Nevi'im). There are 153 passages pointing to Christ in that part.

The first video I have personally seen to discuss this topic in depth and non-believers will also be amazed. Was the flood just a fable? What was the original Chinese religion?  We should be mindful that the oldest known Religion is not a religion at all. It is the Word of God that existed long before man and will continue to exist long after we are gone. Religion is a man-made concept of divinity and worship that has perverted God's Holy Word which has given rise to many false doctrines. But conforming to that description, Judeo Christianity is the oldest form which happens to begin from the time of Adam &amp; Eve but the Jews were not the first to document God and His relationship with mankind.\n\nThe first documentary evidence does not reside in the Torah, but in the ancient writing of the Chinese people and the first God of worship in China. The Chinese have the oldest known form of writing which dates all the way back to 2500 BC. That places these writings within a few Centuries after Noah's Great Flood of the Bible. The writings are well-documented and in those ancient times the Chinese actually worshiped the one true God and Creator. The same God as modern Christians today and to them, his name was Shang Di. \n\nThe modern Chinese religions did not surface until Daoism in the 6th century BC, Confucianism in 5th BC, and Buddhism in the 5th BC. But for over 2000 years, the Chinese people actually worshiped Shang Di and no other. Their ancient manuscripts begin with the text: \n&quot;In the beginning, there was... without form and dark... planets had not begun to revolve, nor the lights to shine. In the midst of it there existed neither form nor sound.&quot;\n\nAs stated in the presentation, &quot;For over 2000 years the Chinese people worshiped a singular surpreme sovereign God who is the Creator of Heaven and Earth... who has the same nature, character and power of Jahovah, YHWH God of the Old Testament.&quot; The Chinese are well-known for documenting historical events and these ancient writings also describe the first written account of the Great Flood in the Bible and the Tower of Babel that later scatterred people everywhere across the world. The ancient Chinese worshiped our God, the most high and documented the Creation story, the biblical flood the tower of babel diaspora and His heavenly plan of Salvation. \n\nYou see, our God loves all of His creation and from the times of Adam &amp; Eve His story lived on. Passed down through the ages to Noah and his family, then onto their descendants. This didn't begin with Abraham and he wasn't the first to receive the Word of God; but the Jews and the Church are God's chosen people to carry us through until the 2nd coming of our Lord and Savior. So should it be surprising that other civilizations that also existed in ancient days had similar knowledge that was passed down fron the descendants of Noah?  That should not be surprising, since it also led to the Tower of Babel, its destruction and the scattering of people in their new tongues after the Flood.\n\nNotably the Chinese people have always been very adept at writing down history so things or events may be remembered for future generations. And their writings are unique because of its characters or symbols are used in picture form which are still used today. But how many are aware that these ancient symbols were originally created to account for the biblical story-line and the Holiness of God 2500 years ago? In other words, from the very start of the Chinese writing, it was created to proclaim the Word of God within its charactures and relfect God's story in its symbols and how they are combined together to from meanings or words. \n\nHowever most modern Chinese are not even aware of how these symbols were used to form or represent meanings. Each characture or word has a purpose that tells us a story; e.g., create, prosperity, garden, forbid, tempter, greed/lust, worry, temptation/Sin, naked, hide, guilt, brother to form Murder and the mark placed on Cain, big boat, tower, confusion, divide, migrate, sacrifice, righteousness = Lamb over me with a spear through its side! in Singapore its simplified, righteousness = blood on the cross! Also eternal/the coming of Christ/washed as white as snow, and faith/confession/grace/salvation!\n\nIn 221 BC, Qin Shi Huang united China and built the Great Wall of China. There were many past Emperors who were believers in God as the knowledge was passed down over generations. Although Qin Shi Huang may not have been a believer, he knew God's word. So he changed the characture for Sin to better reflect the 4 Sins or contradictions in Genesis 3: 1-2, 4-5; the devil's manipulation of Eve to eat the fruit of the forbidden tree!  \n\nChristianity is not just an modern American faith. The ancient Chinese embraced the Word of God that was delivered onto man from long ago. This is their time to renew that faith and realize Christianity is not some modern religious concept. Their own language formed 4500 years ago that is still used today, speaks loudly of the Lord our God, to creation, to the flood, to the tower of Babel, to the sacrifical system, to the coming of Christ and His death on the cross, to the way we may be blessed, to what faith is all about, of our grace and Salvation in the blood of the Lamd of God. Their language shows that the Christian God is the same God of the Chinese people. The one Who is charactized and Whose story is told in their own writing, ranging back to their ancient roots or heritage!\n\nAlso something not stated in this video are the references found in the old writings of the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius who established Confucianism in the 5 BC. He states that he was puzzled by the Shang Di God and the &quot;trinity&quot;. He is noted in questioning, How could three God's be One? To him, the trinity of the Godhead made no sense. As such, he was known for using that to promote his new religion.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.godslastwarning.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.godslastwarning.com&lt;/a&gt;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Word Made Flesh:\n2010-11-14 - Paul Godfrey -  Ever wondered why some highly intelligent people can study the word of God all their life and have no understanding of it? Yet humble fishermen had no problem whatsoever. This hard hitting sermon shows us why.\nmarkwoodman.org\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSigns Jesus is Coming!\nAuthor Frank DiMora shows you many signs in the news pointing to Bible prophecy. These are facts everyone should know about.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN&quot;:\nGet ready to enter a world of wonder God's domain called Heaven. Are you ready to take a journey into another world, a world that is filled with peace and love beyond your imagination, this is &quot;Stairway to HEAVEN&quot;.  These are various life-after-death experiences from many of varying backgrounds who temporarily experienced Heaven and encountered Jesus. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Signs of God's Existence:\nThis well-made documentary deals with the conflict between atheism and theism in the light of modern science. The following documentary contains excerpts of unlicensed footage and images. The expose reveals how science actually verifies the existence of God while the opposing governing satanic orthodoxy remains diligent in concealing these truths from public awareness. Learn what discoveries in science affirm of our Creator, that which many in governement, science, education and the media endeavor to hide from sight.\n\n* Please note, the remaining 12 minute conclusion was censored due to the religious aspirations to deceive listeners into the belief that Allah is the Creator. According to both the the Qu'ran and the Holy Bible, Allah will be the antichrist as witness by many converted Muslims to Christianity. As a true Christian believer in service to Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, the false doctrinal comments were removed at the end. However the rest of the documentary was very well made, so thought it worthy to make the exception and still upload it with the mentioned censorship. Granted, I do not normally condone censorship, however I cannot willfully allow others to fall into the deception either.  \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom Sabbath (Saturday) to sunday:\nThis grand deception is about to erupt.  Please prepare for the consequences.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0683fecd2096ee5ce32219647c8c8d934ea0824","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+End+Times+-+55+-+Foreshadowings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0683fecd2096ee5ce32219647c8c8d934ea0824","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,104,63,236,210,9,110,229,206,50,33,150,71,200,200,217,52,234,8,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
