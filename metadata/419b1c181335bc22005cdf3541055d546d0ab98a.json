It will\nalso write information about the crash to the file `except.txt', which will\nusually show that the game crashed at offset 0x6717CB or 0x6703D4 (for version\n2.03 of `Game.exe'), if it was due to one of the aforementioned bugs.\n\nHowever, crashes at different offsets may also be solved by the bugfixes, as\nsometimes the bugs cause memory corruption that causes crashes later on.\n\nNormally, the crashes occur at offsets 0x6717CB and 0x6703D4 (in version 2.03\nof `Game.exe'), under either of the following conditions:\n    - When firing the GDI Disruptor downwards and scrolling up, so that the\n      sonic energy beam touches the bottom of the game's viewport.\n    - When firing the Nod Laser or Nod Obelisk of Light while scrolling up or\n      down.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:419b1c181335bc22005cdf3541055d546d0ab98a","amp;dn":"Tiberian+Sun+bugfixes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"419b1c181335bc22005cdf3541055d546d0ab98a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,155,28,24,19,53,188,34,0,92,223,53,65,5,93,84,109,10,185,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
