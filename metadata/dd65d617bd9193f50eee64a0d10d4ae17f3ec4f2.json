His terse, precise action movies from the mid-70s to the early 80s Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hard Times, The Driver, The Warriors, The Long Riders, Southern Comfort and 48 Hrs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are unequalled.\n\nhe greatest perhaps is Southern Comfort, a violent fable of ill-trained Louisiana National Guardsmen on a weekend exercise in 1973, inventing their own accidental war with the local Cajun community as they wade through the swampy bayou. It's an allegory about the Vietnam war, a study of American character and a national propensity for violence. This Blu-ray version does full justice to cinematographer Andrew Laszlo's depiction of the bayou as a cold, wet misty hell, of greys, greens and browns, and the twangy, Cajun-inflected score by Ry Cooder provides a mournful, menacing background.\n\nAn atmospheric, tough-as-nails survival tale, and arguably Walter Hill's best movie overall. Well cast with a great Ry Cooder score. Packs a definite wallop.\n\nA lost platoon of National Guardsmen falls foul of a band of bloodthirsty rednecks. Action thriller starring Fred Ward, Powers Boothe and Keith Carradine, and written and directed by Walter Hill\nSet in the swamp-bound bayou of Louisiana, Southern Comfort pits a band of National Guardsmen - led by Fred Ward, Powers Boothe and Keith Carradine - against a motley band of weapon-wielding hillbillies. It's a simple cocktail than produces bloodshed on a truly epic scale - despite the weekend warriors being without firearms. And since the act that angers the locals is nothing greater than the theft of a couple of canoes.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 2.94gb\nDuration.... 01:45:37\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width..... 1280\nFrame Height.... 694\nData Rate.... 3868kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 119kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd65d617bd9193f50eee64a0d10d4ae17f3ec4f2","amp;dn":"Southern+Comfort+1981+BrRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd65d617bd9193f50eee64a0d10d4ae17f3ec4f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,101,214,23,189,145,147,245,14,238,100,160,209,13,74,225,127,62,196,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
