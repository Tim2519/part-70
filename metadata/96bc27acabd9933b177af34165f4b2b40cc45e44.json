It demonstrates how one's ability to make money in the world's financial markets depends critically on an ability to make decisions independently of the crowd. \n\nTony Plummer details the three dimensions essential to achieve successful trading, including an ability to understand the forces at work in logical terms, recognize (and neutralize) any emotional responses to market fluctuations, and design an investment process or trading system that generates objective &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;sell&quot; signals. \n\nTaking the author's latest research into account, this book provides an in-depth assessment of the phenomenon of cycles, patterns of economic and financial activity, and how to use cycles as a forecasting tool.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96bc27acabd9933b177af34165f4b2b40cc45e44","amp;dn":"Forecasting+Financial+Markets%3A+The+Psychology+of+Successful+Inve","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96bc27acabd9933b177af34165f4b2b40cc45e44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,188,39,172,171,217,147,59,23,122,243,65,101,244,178,180,12,196,94,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
