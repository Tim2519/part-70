It is damaging to the medical and psychological well-being of the child and casts a shadow on their future health, leading to serious illness and ultimately premature death. Management of Childhood Obesity provides practical, realistic and easily implemented advice on sensitive approaches to children and their families in a very accessible form for all practitioners involved in the care of overweight children. Changes to diet and activity are reviewed in detail but also with the whole spectrum of eating within the family and community, including sedentariness and the significance of sleep in preventing overweight.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c64f8d9d56f4558005c531eeb58b3028ff568cf9","amp;dn":"Management+of+Childhood+Obesity+-+Pdf+-+Yeal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c64f8d9d56f4558005c531eeb58b3028ff568cf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,79,141,157,86,244,85,128,5,197,49,238,181,139,48,40,255,86,140,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
