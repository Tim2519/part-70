At the time, they did not realize that together they would eventually create music that would persuade a fan of a YouTube video of their performance (Vincent Gosselin, bass) to plead to be a part of it, along with his brother (Sam Gosselin, drums). The stars aligned and Blank Bullets recovered from a hiatus in the summer of 2012 by becoming a five-piece alternative rock band.\n\nTogether, the group would draw its influences from a variety of styles from blues-rock to '90s grunge to contemporary indie rock to psychedelic music of the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s, all while crafting a sound unique to Blank Bullets. Thanks to a blend of styles of rock that appeal to a wide variety of people and their tight group dynamic, the band since gained critical acclaim and has played shows all over Montreal and its surrounding cities.\n\nBlank Bullets released their debut EP September 6, 2013.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:840abe9fe73dcda5efabe5b9e341b7074957c201","amp;dn":"Blank+Bullets+-+Blank+Bullets+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"840abe9fe73dcda5efabe5b9e341b7074957c201","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,10,190,159,231,61,205,165,239,171,229,185,227,65,183,7,73,87,194,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
