The trio's hooks and melodies are sharper, making songs like &quot;Staying Out for the Summer,&quot; &quot;Melodies Haunt You,&quot; &quot;So Let Me Go Far&quot; and &quot;Making the Most Of&quot; indelible slices of punk-pop. There are still a few stray moments where the band gets by on sound, not songs, but Homegrown is overall a tight, invigorating record.
