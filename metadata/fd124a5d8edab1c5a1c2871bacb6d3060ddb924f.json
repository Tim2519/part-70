Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re aiming to get local bands that Dischord wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said founder Lara Connolly. A fairly diverse collection, Mixed Nuts features everything from straight-ahead hardcore (Media Disease), to the thrashy United Mutation, to the noisy post-punk of Chalk Circle and Nuclear Crayons. Chalk Circle was Sharon CheslowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (author of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Banned in D.C.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½) first band and one of the few bands from the early D.C. scene that included female members. Nuclear Crayons and Hate from Ignorance were others. \n\nMp3, 256 kbps. Includes sleeve images.
