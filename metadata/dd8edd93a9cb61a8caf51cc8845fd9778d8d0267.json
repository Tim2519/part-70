The Eternal Present \n\n\n\nEmerging from the widely-divergent Baltimore music scene is singer/ songwriter Caleb Stine who is the soul of that scene, and the best representation of a city he calls, Ã¢â‚¬Å“vibrant, troubled, and passionate.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ His straightforward, honest, music is what Baltimore is at its core Ã¢â‚¬â€œ hardworking, genuine, and unafraid to tell it like it is. Armed with a storytellerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye and a restless independent spirit, Stine is set to deliver his latest album, I WasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Built for a Life Like This, on September 25, 2010.\nHis deeply-personal music falls somewhere between the renegade cowboy-poetry of Townes Van Zandt and the sweet rough and tumble sound of Neil Young's Harvest. \nThis year has been a busy one for Stine. In addition to his solo-touring schedule and regular shows with alt-country rockers The Brakemen, he has collaborated with artists as diverse as Arty Hill (who has been called the future of Honky-tonk by the Houston Press), Kenny Liner of The Bridge, and rapper Saleem. Stine and SaleemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long running partnership has produced the album, Outgrown These Walls, which the Baltimore Sun called, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Truly compelling.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The standout track from the album, Ã¢â‚¬Å“BaltimoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, was used by CNN in a news segment on prescription drug addiction. Stine has also found time this year to score two independent documentaries. \nI WasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Built for a Life Like This, StineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 5th full-length album, is a collection of ten-unflinchingly direct songs in which Stine continues to tell the story of his exploration in what he calls, Ã¢â‚¬Å“an evolving and eroding America. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The New Yorker calls this direct approach, Ã¢â‚¬Å“appropriately train-like, steady and powerful.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ His timeless style of songwriting evokes images of a classic generation of outlaw-country songwriters like Kris Kristofferson, Steve Earle, and Willie Nelson. Each song is glimpse into the heart and soul of America. \nBaltimore Magazine proclaims about his songwriting, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stine weds wide-eyed sensitivity to world-weary tunes with a warm twang. He contemplates right and wrong, love and hate, and questions the durability of whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pure.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd8edd93a9cb61a8caf51cc8845fd9778d8d0267","amp;dn":"Caleb+Stine+-+I+Wasn%27t+Built+for+a+Life+Like+This+%5B2010%5D%5BEAC%2CLOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd8edd93a9cb61a8caf51cc8845fd9778d8d0267","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,142,221,147,169,203,97,168,202,245,28,200,132,95,217,119,141,141,2,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
