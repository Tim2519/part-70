In the original release, Xanadu was 11:43 and The Trees was 6:12, but the tail end of Xanadu carried over to the start of The Trees.  This &quot;fixed&quot; version corrects that oddity.  For the record, I converted the original SHNs to WAV using xAct, edited the tracks using Audacity, exported the tracks as WAV files and then encoded the two new WAV files (Tracks 2 and 3) as SHNs.  I also created new checksums.  In all other respects, the show is identical to the original release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:167225d1d4d9a9e5b9b2520759859096fbe1d93f","amp;dn":"Rush+1979.06.04+Rushian+Roulette+Pink+Pop+Festival+FM+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"167225d1d4d9a9e5b9b2520759859096fbe1d93f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,114,37,209,212,217,169,229,185,178,82,7,89,133,144,150,251,225,217,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
