At least weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve come to a point where most people who really donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like Mandela or what he did canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be totally out front about how they feel. But Nelson Mandela was considered an enemy of the United States on one level or another up until as late as 2008. Ronald Reagan put Nelson MandelaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s African National Congress on the list of terrorist groups. I guess that who goes on your list of terrorists all depends on what terrifies you. What terrified Republicans like Ronald Reagan in the 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s was the thought of a black-run South Africa. And those are the Americans today who are convinced that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re being oppressed in a black-run America.\n\nIn 1985, Congressman Dick Cheney voted against a resolution urging that Mandela be released from jail. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ever unsure about where the wrong side of history is, look for where Dick Cheney is. Dick Cheney said he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t regret his repeated votes in 1986 against the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act which called for freeing Mandela and ending apartheid. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure his only regret is that his opposition didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work.\n\nBill OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly had a few words to say about Nelson Mandela... but most of those words were the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“communist.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bill called Mandela a Ã¢â‚¬Å“communistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ about half a dozen times in the space of a couple of breathsÃ¢â‚¬â€and I think he was trying to eulogize the man! Usually Bill OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly can be as ignorant as he wants to be, but he knew he had to rein it in when he was speaking about MandelaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passing. Still, he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop himself from saying Ã¢â‚¬Å“communistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ like he had some weird kind of Leon Trotsky Tourette Syndrome.\n\nOur guest today is Representative Jared Polis (D-CO), who loudly expressed his frustration with the Republican refusal to move forward on immigration reform on the House floor. In fairness to the Republicans, I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think they have a gear for Ã¢â‚¬Å“forward.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The Republican vehicle has 10 speeds in reverse and none for forward. The closest they can get is Ã¢â‚¬Å“park,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done with immigration reform.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8df39d9fe7cf0a82d2cd32c9509502c2c53aeaa9","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+December+06+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8df39d9fe7cf0a82d2cd32c9509502c2c53aeaa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,243,157,159,231,207,10,130,210,205,50,201,80,149,2,194,197,58,234,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
