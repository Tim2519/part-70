These are the policy- and decision-makers who make the tough choices and the major purchases and sales of the technologies that are employed to keep us safe and secure. \n\n \n\nThe first edition of Ã¢â‚¬Å“HSTodayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ magazine, as it was originally titled, expressly targeted, was edited and designed for AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new post-9/11 homeland security landscape. In unprecedented short order, the HSToday brand quickly became the undisputed independent media that homeland security and industry officials, executives and authorities routinely turn to for accurate, trustworthy and reliable homeland security news, investigations, analysis, context and perspective. \n\n \n\nFrom day one of its launch, the Homeland Security Today brand briskly grew to become a multiple award-winning news medium with far-reaching recognition and respect -- recognition and respect that it has continued to command, and upon which it is building with exciting new products and technological innovations. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08ee8070c2a8ebf85eca1bfd31e3588b42a21a83","amp;dn":"Homeland+Security+Today+2013+12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08ee8070c2a8ebf85eca1bfd31e3588b42a21a83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,238,128,112,194,168,235,248,94,202,27,253,49,227,88,139,66,162,26,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
