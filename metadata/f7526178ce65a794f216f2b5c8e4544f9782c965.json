Both evoke a similar sensation in us Ã¢â‚¬â€ we find them beautiful and magical, but also spooky, sometimes horrifying.\n\nIn this fascinating book, Maitland argues that the two forms are intimately connected: the mysterious secrets and silences, gifts and perils of the forests were both the background and the source of fairytales. Yet both forests and fairy stories are at risk and their loss deprives us of our cultural lifeblood. Maitland visits forests through the seasons, from the exquisite green of a beechwood in spring, to the muffled stillness of a snowy pine wood in winter. She camps with her son Adam, whose beautiful photographs are included in the book; she takes a barefoot walk through Epping Forest with Robert Macfarlane; she walks with a mushroom expert through an oak wood, and with a miner through the Forest of Dean. Maitland ends each chapter with a unique, imaginitive re-telling of a fairystory.\n\nWritten with Sara's wonderful clarity and conversational grace, Gossip from the Forest is a magical and unique blend of nature writing, history and imaginative fiction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7526178ce65a794f216f2b5c8e4544f9782c965","amp;dn":"From+The+Forest+-+Sara+Maitland.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7526178ce65a794f216f2b5c8e4544f9782c965","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,82,97,120,206,101,167,148,242,22,242,181,200,228,84,79,151,130,201,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
