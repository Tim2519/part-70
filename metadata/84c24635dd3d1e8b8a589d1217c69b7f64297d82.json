She and her free-spirited best friend Pia decide to whisk Sancho away to Florida, where DanyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s estranged grandmother lives. Danya is convinced her grandmother is sitting on a nest egg that could save Sancho, and so the two embark upon an epic trip along the majestic Mississippi River. As Danya and Pia face crocodiles, Louisiana casinos, and a surprising instance of what looks like divine intervention, they learn about the true power of family, discovering that magic exists if you know where to look and that sometimes the real treasure we're seeking is with us all along.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84c24635dd3d1e8b8a589d1217c69b7f64297d82","amp;dn":"Snap+-+Ellie+Rollins.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84c24635dd3d1e8b8a589d1217c69b7f64297d82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,194,70,53,221,61,30,139,138,88,157,18,23,198,155,127,100,41,125,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
