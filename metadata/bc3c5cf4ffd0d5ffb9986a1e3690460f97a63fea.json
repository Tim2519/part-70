The Righteous Hillbillies are an axe shredding, ace dealing, foot stompinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Southern rock, high-powered Ameicana, boogie blues band that plays with talent and passion. They have built a strong, supportive, and loyal following throughout their hometown of Joliet, Illinois and into the Chicago area. The Righteous Hillbillies baptize their work in the blood of Lynyrd Skynyrd, AC/DC, ZZ Top, and the Black Crowes while still managing to create an original and independent style. With their dynamic and fiery new album, Trece Diablos, The Righteous Hillbillies are prepared to raise the stakes from entertainment to that old time rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll religion. If it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get you dancing, moving, and singing, you might as well sign your Ã¢â‚¬Å“do not resuscitateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ order at the nearest opportunity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc3c5cf4ffd0d5ffb9986a1e3690460f97a63fea","amp;dn":"The+Righteous+Hillbillies+-+Trece+Diablos+%282013%29+%5BMP3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc3c5cf4ffd0d5ffb9986a1e3690460f97a63fea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,60,92,244,255,208,213,255,185,152,106,30,54,144,70,15,151,166,63,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
