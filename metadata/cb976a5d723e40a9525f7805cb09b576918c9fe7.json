Still, I hear the ghost scream. I hear the screaming and am compelled to write the stories of those whose lives were snatched away. They are the murder victims, the ones who roam restlessly. They are the headliners of this book. Ã¢â‚¬â€Leslie Rule\n\nHauntingsÃ¢â‚¬â€the word conjures up immediate and insatiable curiosity. Paranormal author Leslie Rule explores a new twist on this strange phenomenon when she explores brutal deathsÃ¢â‚¬â€and subsequent hauntingsÃ¢â‚¬â€all over America in When the Ghost Screams. No sector of the country is left untouched by these mystical happenings. The Midwest, Northeast, Southwest, and, of course, Salem, Massachusetts (to which the author has her own bizarre connection), all have unique and gruesome cases of their own ghostly incidents.\n\nFurthermore, Leslie's hometown of Seattle, Wash., is rumored to be haunted and has a violent history of its own that is explored.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb976a5d723e40a9525f7805cb09b576918c9fe7","amp;dn":"When+the+Ghost+Screams+-+Leslie+Rule.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb976a5d723e40a9525f7805cb09b576918c9fe7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,151,106,93,114,62,64,169,82,95,120,5,203,9,181,118,145,140,159,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
