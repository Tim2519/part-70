McShane\nI dislike both country and Christian pop music, but I really love this holiday CD. My whole family likes it too. Trisha Yearwood, Point of Grace, and the London Symphony Orchestra combine to make a lovely album. My mom got it at Hallmark just thinking it would be something nice to listen to, and it exceeded all expectations. The mixing and arrangements of the songs are really nice and it invites you to sing along. It is very cheerful and not overly-produced. It is a good CD to have playing in the background for family gatherings.\n\nSongs on the CD are:\n\n1. It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\n\n2. Silver Bells\n\n3. Winter Wonderland\n\n4. Ding Dong Merrily on High\n\n5. O Holy Night\n\n6. Silent Night\n\n7. Away in a Manger\n\n8. God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\n\n9. Joy to the World\n\n10. O Little Town of Bethlehem\n\n11. Here We Come a Caroling\n\n12. Deck the Halls\n\nI think the &quot;O Holy Night&quot; version is particularly pretty as is the &quot;Here We Come A Caroling&quot; and the London Symphony Orchestra is superb.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a348cfcf70361636ad62a629e7b6a7cbc39ce4e4","amp;dn":"Trisha+Yearwood+-+Home+For+The+Holidays+320cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a348cfcf70361636ad62a629e7b6a7cbc39ce4e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,72,207,207,112,54,22,54,173,98,166,41,231,182,167,203,195,156,228,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
