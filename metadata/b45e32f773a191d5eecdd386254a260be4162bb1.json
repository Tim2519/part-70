Galouye's novel &quot;Simulacron Three&quot; Rainer Werner FassbinderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2 part TV production is a science-fiction classic that explores the notion of a computer-generated other world, pre-dating The Matrix by 26 years. Since its original broadcast in 1973 it has rarely been seen and following increasing demand the Fassbinder Foundation have restored this remarkable film.\n\nSimulacron 1 is a highly advanced project, designed to take computer technology to a new level by creating another world inhabited by computer-generated people or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“identity unitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ that will help to predict future events. When the head of the project dies mysteriously after showing signs of mental disturbance, Dr Stiller becomes his successor. However, Stiller also begins to behave bizarrely. He speaks of people disappearing whom no one else knows, believes someone is trying to murder him and has nausea attacks. As he begins to probe deeper into Simulacron, the line between the real and virtual world becomes increasingly blurred and his own existence is questioned.\n\n\nInkl. special feature: Fassbinder's World on a Wire: Looking Ahead To Today with Michael Ballhaus, Fritz MÃƒÂ¼ller-Scherz, Karl-Heinz Vosgerau, Moritz Eggert, Roland Blach and GÃƒÂ¼nter Rohrbach\n\n\nLanguage: German\nSubtitles: English\n\n2x DVD rip\nRestored version of the Fassbinder Foundation (2010)\n\nmain feature 204min\nspecial feature 49min","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b45e32f773a191d5eecdd386254a260be4162bb1","amp;dn":"Rainer+Werner+Fassbinder+Welt+am+Draht+%281973%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b45e32f773a191d5eecdd386254a260be4162bb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,94,50,247,115,161,145,213,238,205,211,134,37,74,38,11,228,22,43,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
