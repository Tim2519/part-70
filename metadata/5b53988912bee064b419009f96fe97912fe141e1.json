Two marginals who don't know one another stumble into the remnants of a &quot;secret society&quot;: Colin, a seemingly deaf-mute who all of a sudden begins to talk and Frederique, a con artist working the &quot;short con&quot; (stealing drinks and tricking men who think she's a hooker out of their money). Meanwhile there are two theater groups rehearsing classic Greek dramas: &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot; and &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;. A member of the Moretti group passes a note to Leaud about &quot;The 13&quot; which sends Leaud on a search for &quot;The 13&quot;. His search brings him eventually to Bulle Ogier's shop in Les Halles &quot;L'Angle du Hasard.&quot; Berto follows much the same path when she steals a cachet of letters from Jacques Doniol-Valcroze and tries to get money from their owners for their return. These twin activities reactivate &quot;The 13&quot; which had been dormant for years, revealing among other things that the two theater groups were once one. \n\n8 episodes with the common specs:\n\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 050 Kbps\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 850 Kbps\nAspect            : 700 x 572 (1.304) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : de\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nTotal time: 729 min\nTotal size: 10.6 GiB\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246135/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246135/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: French\nSubtitles: German, English\n\nJacques Rivette - Out 1 Noli me tangere (1970) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b53988912bee064b419009f96fe97912fe141e1","amp;dn":"Jacques+Rivette+-+Out+1+Noli+me+tangere+%281970%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b53988912bee064b419009f96fe97912fe141e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,83,152,137,18,190,224,100,180,25,0,159,150,254,151,145,47,225,65,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
