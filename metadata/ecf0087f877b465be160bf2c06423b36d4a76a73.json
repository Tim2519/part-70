Although attacked at the time by the government and the Ã¢â‚¬ËœliberalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ media for alarmism, MoxonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s analysis has now been adopted by most of the major political parties. Indeed his views on the dangers of multiculturalism were even echoed by the Chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, leading the Evening Standard to claim Ã¢â‚¬ËœMoxon appears not so much a racist as a visionaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nBut immigration was never his primary interest, in fact he joined the Home Office in order to study its HR policy, as part of a decade-long investigation of menÃ¢â‚¬â€œwomen. This book is the result. Notwithstanding its provocative title, The Woman Racket is a serious scientific investigation into one of the key myths of our age Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that women are oppressed by the Ã¢â‚¬ËœpatriarchalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ traditions of Western societies. Drawing on the latest developments in evolutionary psychology, Moxon finds that the opposite is true Ã¢â‚¬â€œ men, or at least the majority of low-status males Ã¢â‚¬â€œ have always been the victims of deep-rooted prejudice. As the prejudice is biologically derived, it is unconscious and can only be uncovered with the tools of scientific psychology.\n\nThe book reveals this prejudice in fields as diverse as healthcare, employment, family policy and politics: compared to the long and bloody struggle for universal male suffrage, women were given the vote Ã¢â‚¬Ëœin an historical blink of the eyeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\n297 pages\nPublisher: Imprint Academic (March 1, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1845401506\nISBN-13: 978-1845401504","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecf0087f877b465be160bf2c06423b36d4a76a73","amp;dn":"The+Woman+Racket+%282008%29+by+Steve+Moxon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecf0087f877b465be160bf2c06423b36d4a76a73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,240,8,127,135,123,70,91,225,96,191,44,6,66,59,54,212,167,106,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
