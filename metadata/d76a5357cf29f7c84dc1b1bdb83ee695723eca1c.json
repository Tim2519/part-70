And, of course, the remarkable thing is that this set was obsolete the day it came out, the summing up of what turned out to be only the first phase of Wonder's remarkable career. This album has been superseded by the Looking Back compilation.\nAll Music Review by William Ruhlmann\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Da-Day\n[02] Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\n[03] If You Really Love Me\n[04] For Once In My Life\n[05] We Can Work It Out\n[06] You Met Your Match\n[07] Never Had A Dream Come True\n[08] Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday\n[09] My Cherie Amour\n[10] Never Dreamed You'd Leave In Summer\n[11] Travelin Man\n[12] Heaven Help Us All\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 00h:35m:24s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 86mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
