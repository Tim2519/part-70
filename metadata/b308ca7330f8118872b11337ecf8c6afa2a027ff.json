Not sure what happened with last torrent version..?\nWas removed and my account closed (?)\nMade inquiry, haven't heard back from TPB ...yet.\n\nMaybe I neglected to mention I OWN the Ã‚Â© on these files (?) or... (?)\nWithout further ado, here is some info about this torrent;\n\n_\nHi everyone,\n\nThis is Craig from StucklessPortfolio Dot-Com -my comic book art and boutique site/blog/web presence. I decided to upload not 1 but 2 FREE pdf format publications for all of you to peruse and enjoy!\n\nA little background here about this torrent:\n\nBOTH mini-pubs were printed as a LIMITED EDITION Signed &amp; Numbered book set that I sold at my table in Artist Alley at Comic Book Conventions, as well as sending them out to potential clients publishers as a self-promo. \nOnce my stock of PRINT books were depleted I decided to make a DIGITAL version(s) to share with folks who have such an interest in such subjects as; Comic Books, Sequential Art, Commercial Art and Pop Culture in general.\n\nIn conclusion myself being an indie publisher, I sure could use all the support I can get. Although I'm not NEW to selling my services in the area of Commercial Art I AM NEW to this milieu i.e. Comic Books. \n\nI am also NEW to torrenting as THIS is my FIRST (2nd version) torrent! IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done everything in my power to make entertaining and (hopefully) thought provoking publications for folks to read, and so as NOT to waste bandwidth to make a quality Ã¢â‚¬Å“product(s)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Please be kind in the comments section, and PLEASE SEED this torrent...\n\nThat all being said , the following is a brief tittle and description as to what the Publications in this download are about...\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Production Manual : Sequential Art + More From The Pages Of Manuals #01 - 10Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2010)\n\nMy creative output or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Artistic ProcessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has come full circle now. I began in Commercial Art &amp; worked for a number of studios for awhile, then I dabbled with the Fine Arts by way of selling Paintings &amp; Photographs at galleries, to taking a sabbatical and then refocusing my efforts back to my Ã¢â‚¬Å“true loveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that being Comic Books. Its as much a Ã¢â‚¬Å“retrospectiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as it is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“futurespectiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of where I am going with my workÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Unknowable : A Mini-Comic For Your Intuitive-SelfÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2011)\n\nThis wordless narrative jumps across time and space to all sorts of cultures/societies and moments in history and in the present. I Ã¢â‚¬Å“engineeredÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ it in such a way as TO BE very open-ended as the reader brings their world-view to this narrative provoking a myriad of interpretations. However, there IS an afterward at the end of the Publication that not only sheds light on what my inspiration was but also what sort of a Ã¢â‚¬Å“pointÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ I was trying to make. I thought this could also serve as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“PrimerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for those who ARE aware of certain Ã¢â‚¬Å“PerceptionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ about our world to those who may not be soÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nMany thanks for downloading &amp; SEEDING,\nCraig.\n2013\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b308ca7330f8118872b11337ecf8c6afa2a027ff","amp;dn":"FREE_Mini-Comic_%26amp%3B_Artbook_from_StucklessPortfolio_Dot_Com","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b308ca7330f8118872b11337ecf8c6afa2a027ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,8,202,115,48,248,17,136,114,177,19,55,236,248,198,175,162,160,39,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
