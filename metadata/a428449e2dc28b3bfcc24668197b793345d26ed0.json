The electronic soundscape and mechanical effects give way to a guitarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sparse wail and the slow tones of Stornoway poet Kevin MacNeil. I actually met MacNeil once, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sad and humorous story for another day.\n\nThere Will Be Fireworks is an incredibly fluid record: ebbing and flowing from acoustic love-songs to sweeping post-rock, and seeming entirely timeless while doing it. As the perfect innocence of young love in Ã¢â‚¬Å“GuisingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ explodes into the frenetic chaos of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Off With Their HeadsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to tell where one song ends and the next begins, making it feel cohesive and fragmented at the same time: an epic series of starkly juxtaposed movements.\n\nThe gentle piano and slow brass of Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Kind of FurnaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ seems so far removed from the crashing climax of Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Were A Roman CandleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, but it works so seamlessly that you find yourself unable to argue. The live-recorded instrumentation lends the sound a unique warmth and urgency, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s simply beautiful.\n\nEverything about this album - from the subtle interweaving of precise guitars, classical instruments, and electronic noise to Nicholas McManusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ emotive vocals and thoughtful, charmingly naÃƒÂ¯ve songwriting - comes together to create one of the most sophisticated and varied debut albums I have ever heard...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a428449e2dc28b3bfcc24668197b793345d26ed0","amp;dn":"There+Will+Be+Fireworks+-+There+Will+Be+Fireworks+%5B2009%5D%5BEAC.Log","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a428449e2dc28b3bfcc24668197b793345d26ed0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,40,68,158,45,194,139,59,252,194,70,104,25,123,121,51,69,210,110,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
