It was directed by Clarence Brown.\n\nA Free Soul became famous for a sequence where Barrymore delivers a monologue that is said to be the main reason he won the Academy Award for Best Actor that year. (Norma Shearer was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role and Clarence Brown for Best Director.) Gable made such an impression in the role of a gangster who pushes Shearer around that he was catapulted from supporting player to leading man, a position he held for the rest of his career.\n\nAccording to the Guinness Book of World Records (2002), A Free Soul holds the record for the longest take in a commercial film, the final courtroom scene at 14 minutes. Since a reel of camera film lasts only 10 minutes, the take was achieved by using more than one camera.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Norma Shearer as Jan Ashe\n    Leslie Howard as Dwight Winthrop\n    Lionel Barrymore as Stephen Ashe\n    James Gleason as Eddie\n    Clark Gable as Ace Wilfong\n    Lucy Beaumont as Grandma Ashe\n\nStephen Ashe, an upper class alcoholic defense attourney, successfully defends local mobster Ace Wilfong in a murder case.
