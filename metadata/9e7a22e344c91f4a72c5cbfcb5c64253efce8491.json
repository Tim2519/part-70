After signing to Virgin Records, Brother Cane issued their self-titled debut LP in 1993, with the first single &quot;Got No Shame&quot; becoming a major hit at AOR radio; a short time later, however, Maxey quit the band, at which time Glick assumed bass duties, and with new guitarist David Anderson they soon returned to the studio to begin work on 1995's Seeds. Wishpool followed in 1998, launching the hit &quot;I Lie in the Bed I Make.&quot;\nBrother Cane's lineup changed shortly before they hit the studio to record this album, and the group's music has certainly changed a bit since their self-titled debut release in 1993. The band's second LP, Seeds, is a slick, heavy recording that dares to oppose '90s punk rock with their own combination of classic '70s rock and '90s grunge. The music and lyrics flow throughout, making it a very likable record. Standouts include &quot;And Fools Shine On&quot; and &quot;Breadmaker.&quot;..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e7a22e344c91f4a72c5cbfcb5c64253efce8491","amp;dn":"Brother+Cane+-+Seeds+%5B1995%5D%5BEAC.Log%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e7a22e344c91f4a72c5cbfcb5c64253efce8491","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,122,34,227,68,201,31,74,114,197,203,252,181,198,66,83,239,206,132,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
