Moving beyond this caricature, 1536 - focusing on a pivotal year in the life of the King - reveals a fuller portrait of this complex monarch, detailing the finer shades of humanity that have so long been overlooked. We discover that in 1536 Henry met many failures - physical, personal, and political - and emerged from them a different man: a revolutionary new king who proceeded to transform a nation and reform a religion.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f677456d7870800eda18fa62b389f572f59b163c","amp;dn":"1536+-+The+Year+that+Changed+Henry+VIII++%282011+-+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f677456d7870800eda18fa62b389f572f59b163c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,119,69,109,120,112,128,14,218,24,250,98,179,137,245,114,245,155,22,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
