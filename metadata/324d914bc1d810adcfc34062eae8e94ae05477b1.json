It's title does not indicate well\n\nwhat it is.  It is VIK LX-1103 (...plays Lerner and Loewe 12&quot; 1st 6 tracks) with\n\nother tracks added from sessions around the same time period.\n\n\n\nThe CD is titled:   ART BLAKEY &amp; THE JAZZ MESSENGERS (1957)\n\n                    Second Edition\n\n                    Featuring Johnny Griffin\n\n\n                    Bluebird 07863    66661-2\n\n\n\n\nTracks 1-6)  Quintet:  PLAYS LERNER AND LOEWE   (VIK LX-1103)  12&quot; record\n\n\nTracks 7-9)  Nonet:    Messengers + 4\n\n\nTracks 10-11) Sextet:  Add Jackie McLean (alto) to above quintet \n\n\n\n\n\n......two factors made the session of March 13 unique.  One was the arrival of\n\ntenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin, who was in the process of taking over the\n\nsaxophone chair from McLean. ...............for his Messengers debut,.......\n\nGriffin is the lone saxophone and uses the circumstance to provide a magnif-\n\nicent display of his extravagant talent.  His fierce attack, blinding speed\n\ncaustic humor and ability to blend bebop abstraction with the more extroverted\n\ndisplays of rhythm and blues had already won him record dates of his own;\n\nand his ability to thrive over the constant GOADING of Blakey's drums only\n\nenhanced his reputation.  Material (is the other factor)  \n\n\n\nBob Blumenthal (paraphrased)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:324d914bc1d810adcfc34062eae8e94ae05477b1","amp;dn":"BLAKEY%3BMESSENGERS%281957%29%26quot%3BLerner+and+Loewe%26quot%3B+VIK+LX-1103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"324d914bc1d810adcfc34062eae8e94ae05477b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,77,145,75,193,216,16,173,207,195,64,98,234,232,233,74,224,84,119,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
