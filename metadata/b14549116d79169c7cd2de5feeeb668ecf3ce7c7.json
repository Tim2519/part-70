Widely considered one of Brazil's rising young guitar talents, Amorim has performed throughout the world with some of Brazil's most noted musicians, such as Celia Vaz, Mauricio Einhorn, Helio Delmiro and Vittor Santos. On this new recording, Marcos is joined by master Brazilian percussionist Robertinho Silva and bassist Ney ConceÃƒÂ§iÃƒÂ£o. Guitarist Amorim has found great inspiration from both American and Brazilian guitarists and composers alike, and has used these influences as a springboard to create his own unique and distinctive tone and approach to both electric and acoustic guitars on this highly charged and exciting outing. \n\n01 - Marcos Amorim - Juca e Helena.flac\n02 - Marcos Amorim - Manaira.flac\n03 - Marcos Amorim - Baden.flac\n04 - Marcos Amorim - Cristina Na Fazenda.flac\n05 - Marcos Amorim - Trenzinho para Vera Cruz.flac\n06 - Marcos Amorim - O Boto.flac\n07 - Marcos Amorim - Bons Amigos.flac\n08 - Marcos Amorim - Largos das Neves.flac\n09 - Marcos Amorim - Sodalita.flac\n10 - Marcos Amorim - Mr. Birdman.flac\n11 - Marcos Amorim - Procissao.flac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b14549116d79169c7cd2de5feeeb668ecf3ce7c7","amp;dn":"Cris+On+The+Farm+%28Marcos+Amorim%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b14549116d79169c7cd2de5feeeb668ecf3ce7c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,69,73,17,109,121,22,156,124,210,222,95,238,235,102,142,207,60,231,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
