It was produced by UPN from 1998 to 2001.\n\nThe plot follows a secret branch of the United States' National Security Agency who have developed a time travelling device based upon alien technology found at Roswell. As the opening of the show says, the Chronosphere, or Backstep Sphere, sends &quot;one human being back in time seven days&quot; to avert disasters. The show's name refers to the fact that the Backstep Project can only backstep seven days because of limitations imposed by the fuel source and its reactor. As the fuel source is limited, there is a strict mandate that they only Backstep for events relating to &quot;National Security&quot;. The backstep team and the equipment are stationed in a base called Never Never Land, which is in a secret location somewhere in the desert of Nevada.\n\nTV Rip\nVIDEO:\nContainer: MKV\nCodec: H264 @ 472 kbps\nResolution: 480 x 360 (4:3 aspect ratio) \n\nAUDIO: MP3 @ 128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74f8de55154ba1b9f1fbcdc751637f89256e7134","amp;dn":"Seven+Days+%28aka+7+Days%29+Complete+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74f8de55154ba1b9f1fbcdc751637f89256e7134","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,248,222,85,21,75,161,185,241,251,205,199,81,99,127,137,37,110,113,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
