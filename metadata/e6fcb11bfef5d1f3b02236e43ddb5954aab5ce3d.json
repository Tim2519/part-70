They were nominated for a 1983 Juno Award as Most Promising Group of the Year and again in 1985 as Group of the Year. Their 1982 album Worlds Away was a Canadian gold selling record.\n\nStrange Advance was initially made up of Drew Arnott (keyboards, percussion, vocals), Darryl Kromm (lead vocals, guitars), and Paul Iverson (bass). The three met up in Vancouver and founded the group in 1980. Initially called &quot;Metropolis&quot;, they were forced to change their name after discovering a band in Germany using &quot;Metropolis&quot;.\n\nThe group's first album, Worlds Away, featured the title track &quot;Worlds Away&quot;, which saw modest airplay in North American markets in 1983. The album was produced by Bruce Fairbairn, known for his work with Loverboy and Prism, but featured a very different sound from those groups. Rather than commercial hard rock, Strange Advance's music was a fusion of progressive rock and new wave, with a heavy reliance on synthesizers and keyboards.\n\nIverson left the group after the first album and was not replaced. The group's 1985 album 2WO also went Gold in Canada and was produced by Arnott, using an extensive array of session players, and brought the band their first big Canadian hit with &quot;We Run&quot;. Strange Advance had never played a live gig prior to 1985, so Arnott and Kromm added musicians Ric deGroot (keyboards), Ian Cameron (guitar, violin), Joey Alvero (bass) and David Quinton (drums) to the line-up as session players, and supported the first two albums with a tour of Eastern Canada.\n\nStrange Advance's third album, 1988's The Distance Between also used sessioneers (including Randy Bachman and Allan Holdsworth), and produced the top 20 single &quot;Love Becomes Electric&quot;. Following this album's release, the group became essentially inactive.\n\nIn 1995, the Strange Advance compilation album Worlds Away &amp; Back featured a mix of previously released material, outtakes, remixes, demos, and three newly recorded tracksÃ¢â‚¬â€one from 1991, and two from 1995.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6fcb11bfef5d1f3b02236e43ddb5954aab5ce3d","amp;dn":"Strange+Advance+-+Over+60+Minutes+With+%5B1987%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6fcb11bfef5d1f3b02236e43ddb5954aab5ce3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,252,177,27,254,245,209,243,176,34,54,228,61,219,89,84,170,181,206,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
