Case in point was the first song, &quot;Ghana'e,&quot; based on an African children's song and given a vocal reading (by both Lavoe and the band chorus) that invoked a sense of joy and wonder quite at odds with the cutthroat world of New York salsa. Throughout the album, ColÃƒÂ³n's septet was tight as usual (they had freed themselves completely from their Latin soul and novelty past) but they performed songs at many different paces and left plenty of space in their sound -- yet still never sacrificed the power of ColÃƒÂ³n and Willie Campbell's dual-trombone lineup. The son montuno &quot;Pa' Colombia&quot; or the powerful &quot;Barrunto&quot; were the clearest hits to those who were already ColÃƒÂ³n fans, but the rest of the material stretched ColÃƒÂ³n's rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ©, including the melancholy &quot;No CambiarÃƒÂ©,&quot; an affectionate look at the power of grandmothers (and mothers) in &quot;Abuelita,&quot; and salutes to Puerto Rico, Colombia, Brazil, and Mexico as well as the Estados Unidos.
