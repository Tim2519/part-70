She is happy in the forest with only her friend Urso -- a giant bear -- for company. She wants nothing to do with the world of men.\n\nBut the ferocious creature that killed her father is still out there, and Atalanta can't resist the opportunity to hunt it down, even if that means she has to join forces with a group of hunters to do so. Atalanta must prove that she is as strong and brave as any of the others, as they search together for the deadly Arcadian Beast.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc9f015ee91a15010ef93d56bc94bf67eb35dc54","amp;dn":"Atalanta+and+the+Arcadian+Beast+-+Robert+J.+Harris+%26amp%3B+Jane+Yo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc9f015ee91a15010ef93d56bc94bf67eb35dc54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,159,1,94,233,26,21,1,14,249,61,86,188,148,191,103,235,53,220,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
