A poetic visionary and a technical master of oils, he painted everything, from frescoes and grand altarpieces to mythological stories and portraitsÃ¢â‚¬â€works described by his contemporaries as &quot;mirrors of nature.&quot;\n\nSheila Hale's rich biography is the first since 1877 to examine all contemporary accounts of Titian's life and work as well as recent art historical scholarship, some of it previously unpublished. Her book charts the extraordinary transformation of Titian's style: from the radiant, minutely realized masterpieces of his youth, to the more freely painted work of his middle years, to the dark, tragic, sometimes terrifying visions of his old age. Drawing on the latest scientific examinations of his paintings, Hale seeks to explain the evolution of his methods and his art. In doing so, she also gives many different voicesÃ¢â‚¬â€from Titian's lifetime to todayÃ¢â‚¬â€free reign to explore, praise, and sometimes doubt his genius.\n\nWhen Titian died in 1576, in his late eighties, he had spent the whole of his working life in VeniceÃ¢â‚¬â€the most celebrated city in EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â€traveling as little as possible despite the clamor for his presence at the great courts of the continent. He had witnessed wars, Ottoman invasions, and the rising Protestant threat to the Catholic Church. He had become the favored painter of both Charles VÃ¢â‚¬â€the most powerful man in the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€and his son, Philip II of Spain, who became Titian's most important patron.\n\nSheila Hale's masterly biography presents Titian through the lens of the turbulent times in which he lived and explores how this innovative sixteenth-century master conveyed in his paintings a kind of truth that few other artists have been able to communicate, which has fascinated Titian's admirers and followers ever since.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02255/hudson_main1_2255014b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02255/hudson_main1_2255014b.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nabout this author :-\n\nSheila Hale has known and often lived in Venice since 1965, when\nshe began work as research assistant to the late John Hale, with\nwhom she worked on Renaissance Venice and The Civilization of\nEurope in the Renaissance .
