S. NaipaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impassioned and prescient travelogue of his journeys through his ancestral homeland, with a new preface by the author.\n \nArising out of NaipaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifelong obsession and passion for a country that is at once his and totally alien, India: A Million Mutinies Now relates the stories of many of the people he met traveling there more than fifty years ago. He explores how they have been steered by the innumerable frictions present in Indian societyÃ¢â‚¬â€the contradictions and compromises of religious faith, the whim and chaos of random political forces. This book represents NaipaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last word on his homeland, complementing his two other India travelogues, An Area of Darkness and India: A Wounded Civilization.\n\nPaperback: 544 pages\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0307739732\nISBN-13: 978-0307739735","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef7240015df990e9c41cd25d1cc30937651922ce","amp;dn":"India_A+Million+Mutinies+Now_VS+Naipaul+by+EbookDentist","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef7240015df990e9c41cd25d1cc30937651922ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,114,64,1,93,249,144,233,196,28,210,93,28,195,9,55,101,25,34,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
