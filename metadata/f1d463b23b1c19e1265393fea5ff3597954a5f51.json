When President Obama got up to speak, the crowd gave him a huge cheer. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always nice to be reminded that we in America today have a historic figure as our leader too.\n\nNewt Gingrich is now saying that the death of Nelson Mandela is Ã¢â‚¬Å“just another excuse for the left to smear Ronald Reagan.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Actually, Newt, we look on it more as a moment to expose Ronald Reagan for what he really was. Reagan put Mandela on a terrorist list, and vetoed sanctions against South Africa. In fact, if Reagan were alive today, he would say... well, he would probably be telling the exact same lies that Newt Gingrich is. Newt claims that Reagan condemned apartheid. If he did, he said that while actively working to support the apartheid regime. So what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re saying is that Reagan was a hypocrite on top of everything else.\n\nGeorge ZimmermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s girlfriend now says she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to press charges against him. Wow! George sure can pick Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem... and by Ã¢â‚¬Å“pick Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I mean pick women stupid enough to let him pick Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem. Samantha Scheibe now tells the court Ã¢â‚¬Å“I am not afraid of George in any manner and I want to be with him.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tell that to the court, sweetieÃ¢â‚¬â€tell that to a shrink. Thanks for everything, Samantha. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see you the next time George points a gun at youÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ assuming of course, that he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pull the trigger this time.\n\nWorld Net Daily contributor Jack Cashill said the Justice Department investigation of George Zimmerman was Ã¢â‚¬Å“like going after Nelson Mandela on civil rights.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ My God, man! Please allow poor Nelson Mandela to be laid into his grave before he turns over in it!\n\nFinally, the Christmas nativity scene in the Florida state capitol is going to be joined by a Festivus pole made of empty beer cans. If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what Festivus is, well then the people who are waging the War on Festivus are winning. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trying to take the Ã¢â‚¬Å“FestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ out of Ã¢â‚¬Å“FestivusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½! Let me add that to my list for the Ã¢â‚¬Å“airing of the grievances.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1d463b23b1c19e1265393fea5ff3597954a5f51","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+December+10+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1d463b23b1c19e1265393fea5ff3597954a5f51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,212,99,178,59,28,25,225,38,83,147,254,165,255,53,151,149,74,95,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
