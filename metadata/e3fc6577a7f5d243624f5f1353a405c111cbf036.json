No sooner has their cruise on the Nile begun, however, than an attempt is made on Ethelred's life. When the boat's engine explodes and a passenger is found bloodily murdered, suspicion falls on everyone aboard Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including a third-rate private eye, two individuals who may or may not be undercover police, and Ethelred himself. As the boat drifts out of control, though, it seems that events are being controlled by a party far more radical than anyone could have guessed. Herring on the Nile is an ingenious mystery, and a darkly funny tribute to Agatha Christie and the golden age of crime fiction. 'Tyler juggles characters, story, wit and clever one-liners with perfect balance' The Times","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3fc6577a7f5d243624f5f1353a405c111cbf036","amp;dn":"Herring+on+the+Nile+-+L.+C.+Tyler.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3fc6577a7f5d243624f5f1353a405c111cbf036","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,252,101,119,167,245,210,67,98,79,95,19,83,164,5,193,17,203,240,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
