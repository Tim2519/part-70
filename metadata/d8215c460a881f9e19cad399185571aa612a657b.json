Spitfire Percussion is a genre defining bench mark, offering ultimate playability, reality, with the impact but also clarity of the hall, and a controllability and depth not to be found anywhere else in a library of this type. As with all of our modules, this is designed specifically for the media composer and we hope it will be a tool for music makers to use for generations to come.\n\nThis is simply vast array of instruments stretching over 160 patches, grouped across, Drums Hi, Drums Lo, Mallets Metal (which includes the Harry Potter celeste!), Mallets Wood, Timpani, Toys, Unpitched Metal (including some awesome cinematic anvils and a selection of amazing trash) and Unpitched Wood. However we havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bored you with hundreds of different beater types, we have built Ã¢â‚¬â€œ we believe Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the definitive Marimba patch, alongside the vibraphone, and xylophone, and a definitive timpani featuring a multi stick dynamic &amp; pitch range that gives a powerful but controllable sound as the percussionist would play it on the scoring stage.\n\nAll instruments are deeply sampled with up to 8 round robins per dynamic and up to 8 dynamics per note.\n\nAll instruments have the ability to mix and/or mute mic positions from the front panel: Close mics, Decca tree and Ambient outriggers. Route the spots into your centre channel, the tree in L&amp;R and the ambients in Ls &amp; Rs, and you also have a perfect 5.0 perc library. Or simply keep in stereo and mix according to taste. All controls can be fully automated.\n\nWe are confident that once you buy this, you will never buy another orchestral percussion library.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nUp to 8 round robins recorded at up to 8 dynamic layers, the definitive orchestral percussion range.
