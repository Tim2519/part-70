Beatty concludes that, far from the stereotyped portrayal of nervous patients in contemporary fiction, 'nervousness' was a legitimate medical diagnosis with a firm basis in eighteenth-century medical theory.\n=====================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5084107829312605ad5e86eaacc254f258a2d429","amp;dn":"Heather+R.+Beatty+-+Nervous+Disease+in+Late+Eighteenth-Century+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5084107829312605ad5e86eaacc254f258a2d429","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,132,16,120,41,49,38,5,173,94,134,234,172,194,84,242,88,162,212,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
