This means going beyond the phone to how your phone interacts with the rest of your devices and going beyond just music playback to an immersive music experience. We want Winamp for Android to be the Ultimate Media Player for Android devices. When music is the question, we want the answer to be Winamp. The Winamp Labs page provides users with access to our latest experiments.\n\nHow To Use\nThe latest Beta version of Winamp for Android is available for download from this page. Because you are Ã¢â‚¬Å“side-loadingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the Winamp Android app, i.e. not downloading and installing from Google Play, any of the Winamp for Android add-ons (Lyrics, Album Washer, or Winamp Pro) you have purchased will be temporarily unavailable, but we are working to fix that issue for users of this Beta version as soon as possible. Additionally, to install this Beta version you will have to go to your Android OS Application settings and enable the following settings: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Allow installation of non-Market applicationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Also, before installing new beta builds from this Labs page, we recommend that you first uninstall the previous version.\n\nWinamp for Android &amp; Winamp Cloud\nAt Winamp, we understand that your music lives in multiple places. Whether it is on a personal computer, mobile phone, networked drive or a cloud storage locker. Access to all your music can be difficult without continuously moving music around your various devices. Well, with Winamp Cloud, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have easy access to all your music wherever it is stored, as one collective library of music.\n\nWinamp Cloud is currently in Ã¢â‚¬Å“invite onlyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ beta. To gain access, please register at cloud.winamp.com. We will be periodically sending invites. You can also register for an invite by clicking the Cloud button in this Winamp for Android Labs version of the app.\n\nFeedback, Tell Us Everything\nThe beta builds include features that are still under development and we are making them available for you to try out! Once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had a chance to use the new features, please send us feedback on how you think they are working. Please participate in the Winamp for Android beta forum discussion with the Winamp Team and other beta testers. You can also send us feedback directly to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;95f3f0f0f1f7f4f6feb8f4fbf1e7fafcf1b8f7f0e1f4d5e2fcfbf4f8e5bbf6faf8bb&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; By downloading and using a beta version of Winamp for Android from our labs page, we will be collecting your email address in order to communicate with you directly. We may periodically send you emails with regards to the beta application and program.\n\nThis Llama May Bite\nWhile the features in the beta app have been in development for a while, these Ã¢â‚¬Å“betaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ versions of the product are not yet Ã¢â‚¬Å“releaseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ready and crashes are possible. We are also potentially testing features that may or may not make the final release. As a beta tester, we ask that you try the new features and share your experience by sending feedback. Your participation could land you some limited edition Winamp SWAG. Thank you for helping us build a better Winamp!
