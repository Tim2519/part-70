But a dark past and even darker secrets are threatening to bubble over her perfect faÃƒÂ§ade. She'll do anything to keep the emptiness inside hidden-which leads her into situations that always end badly. Whenever she hits bottom, there's only one person who's there to pull her out: Ethan Gregory.\n\nEthan set the rules a long time ago: he and Lila are just friends. He doesn't do relationships. Although his tattooed, bad boy exterior is a far cry from Lila's pretty princess image, Ethan can't deny they have a deeper connection than he's used to. If he's not careful, he could be in serious danger of becoming attached-and he's learned the hard way that attachment only leads to heartbreak.\n\nWhen Lila falls farther than she ever has before, can Ethan continue to help as a friend? Or is he also getting close to falling . . . for her?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6b995b22be331b4acad784e429eb406881794a4","amp;dn":"The+Temptation+of+Lila+and+Ethan+%5BThe+Secret%2C+%233%5D+-+Jessica+Sore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6b995b22be331b4acad784e429eb406881794a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,185,149,178,43,227,49,180,172,173,120,78,66,158,180,6,136,23,148,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
