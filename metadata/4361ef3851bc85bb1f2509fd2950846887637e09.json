However injured his body may be, his mind is as active as ever. Too active, perhaps. When he glimpses a shadowy figure from his bedroom window struggling with a heavy load, the tranquil faÃƒÂ§ade of the village begins to loom sinister. . .\n\nUnable to forget the incident, Robert confides in his childhood friend, Miss Lucy Harrington. As the dutiful daughter of the widowed rector, following up on the major's suspicions offers a welcome diversion--but soon presents real danger. Someone is intent on stopping their investigation. And in a place where no one locks their doors, a series of thefts and the disappearance of two young serving girls demands explanation. . .\n\nAs Robert grapples with his difficult recovery, he and Lucy try to unearth the dark truth lurking within the village shadows, and stop a killer waiting to strike again...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4361ef3851bc85bb1f2509fd2950846887637e09","amp;dn":"Death+Comes+to+the+Village+-+Catherine+Lloyd.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4361ef3851bc85bb1f2509fd2950846887637e09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,97,239,56,81,188,133,187,31,37,9,253,41,80,132,104,135,99,126,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
