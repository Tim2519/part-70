Like the Swan River that flows in two directions at once at certain times, with the fresh water flowing seawards above the salty water flowing in beneath it, Perth strikes perfect harmony with the city's contradictions and eccentricities. We look beyond shiny glass facades and boosterish talk of mining booms to the richness of the natural world and the trailblazers, the rebels, the occasional ghost and the ordinary people that bring Australia's remotest city to life.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3b4851f011e85d7c2aa03701ee15ea0a05a870b","amp;dn":"Perth++%282013+-+Retail+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3b4851f011e85d7c2aa03701ee15ea0a05a870b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,180,133,31,1,30,133,215,194,170,3,112,30,225,94,160,160,90,135,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
