Tukaram is however not interested in worldly matters and is always immersed in God. He is a fervent devotee of Panduranga, whose praises he sings daily. He faces a lot of problems because of his devotion. People take advantage of his nature, and cheat him. His family suffers, and his first wife Rukma dies of starvation during a famine. His family falls on hard times, and he questions the very existence of God. When he tries to commit suicide in despair, he experiences Divine Enlightenment, and becomes totally devoted to God. He starts writing kirtans or Abhangs devoted to the God. This is not liked by the orthodox priests, as he belonged to a lower caste. They make him throw all his work into the Indrayani river. When the river Goddess miraculously gives him back all his work, the people of the village are convinced of his divine nature. His fame spreads to such an extent, that even the great emperor Shivaji comes down to meet him.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Bitrate: 1295 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: Telugu\nRunTime: 2:48:07\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 2:48:07","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:828fd3d464725bf5bd294b1b9803f11171cea200","amp;dn":"Bhakta+Tukaram+%281973%29+Telugu+-+Xvid+2cd+-+No+Subs+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"828fd3d464725bf5bd294b1b9803f11171cea200","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,143,211,212,100,114,91,245,189,41,75,27,152,3,241,17,113,206,162,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
