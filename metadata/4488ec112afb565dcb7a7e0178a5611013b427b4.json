The game has a unique approach to storytelling without using  any  written or spoken words. Therefore it requires the player to be actively  involved to understand the narrative. The story itself becomes part of the  puzzle. Gameplay, visuals and the very  limited  color  palette  are  used  in  an expressionist way to help telling the story. The player will find lots  of references to other movies, books and games  in  the  dystopian  world  of Monochroma. The challenge of the game is to make the  player  think  about himself, his role in the society and the system were living in.\n\nThe gameplay, deriving from the story, consists of a boy that has to  take care of his younger brother who injures his leg in the  beginning  of  the game. The younger brother is afraid of the dark therefore the  player  can only put him down under the light to be  able  to  jump  higher  and  move faster but the player cant leave him behind just as in real life.\n\nMonochroma features realistic locations  and  puzzles  blending  with  the environment. Puzzle designs are far from the  arbitrary  trial  and  error gameplay but still challenging. If the players dies the game  has  a  fast checkpoint system that doesnt punish the player.\n\n\nInstallation Information:\n=========================\n\n* Burn or mount\n* Install\n* Play the game\n\nNOTE: As usual, block the game exe in your firewall.\n\n/TEAM FAiRLIGHT\n\n\n+-+  QUALITY, TRADITION  AND PRIDE +-+\n\nScreens:\n========\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wqKVG16.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wqKVG16.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/QcrTmn3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/QcrTmn3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/EzdYEOy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/EzdYEOy.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/lDGNvEV.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/lDGNvEV.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nqzq8Cl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nqzq8Cl.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/STLPBSJ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/STLPBSJ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4488ec112afb565dcb7a7e0178a5611013b427b4","amp;dn":"Monochroma-FLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4488ec112afb565dcb7a7e0178a5611013b427b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,136,236,17,42,251,86,93,203,122,126,1,120,165,97,16,19,180,39,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
