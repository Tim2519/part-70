He ends up in a city with people who are suspicious he is a spy and who want to keep him to procreate with the rulers daughter because the majority of the inhabitants are sterile. He manages to escape and return to his own time but &quot;with consequences&quot;.\n\nThis is another that has been posted in the past but some may have missed. When I was a kid, this is the kind of movie mom would let the kids go to alone. (she didn't want to see it basically) couldn't figure out why. To me it was just great.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72cb982b4802751403c3c02657d90f361fe6c1e0","amp;dn":"Beyond+The+Time+Barrier+%281960%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72cb982b4802751403c3c02657d90f361fe6c1e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,203,152,43,72,2,117,20,3,195,192,38,87,217,15,54,31,230,193,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
