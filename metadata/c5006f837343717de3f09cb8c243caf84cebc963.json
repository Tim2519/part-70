With his navigation equipment and radio disabled, the man sails unknowingly into the path of a violent storm. Despite his success in patching the breached hull, his mariner's intuition and a strength that belies his age, the man barely survives the tempest. Using only a sextant and nautical maps to chart his progress, he is forced to rely on ocean currents to carry him into a shipping lane in hopes of hailing a passing vessel. But with the sun unrelenting, sharks circling and his meager supplies dwindling, the ever-resourceful sailor soon finds himself staring his mortality in the face.\n\n\n\nEncoder: Frontline - The Riddler  \n\n\nHar fjernet hardcodet tekster.\n\n\n\n \nVideo\n\nType: H.264/AVC\nOriginal duration:  01:35:39:01\nBitrate:  1,26 Mbps\nResolution:  720X406\nFrame rate :  25 fps\nFrame type:  Progressive\n\n\n\nAudio\n\nType: AAC\nSampling rate:  44kHz\nBitrate:  160Kbps\nChannel:  Stereo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5006f837343717de3f09cb8c243caf84cebc963","amp;dn":"All.Is.Lost.2013.HDRip.X264.Custom.Dk.Subs-Frontline","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5006f837343717de3f09cb8c243caf84cebc963","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,0,111,131,115,67,113,125,227,240,156,184,194,67,202,248,76,235,201,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
