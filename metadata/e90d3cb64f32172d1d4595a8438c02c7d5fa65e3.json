Rich is trapped in the lab after mysteriously finding a picture of the missing Jackson on a computer, but Laura arrives and manages to rescue him. At the same time, Caitlin is knocked out trying to reach Miles and doesn't make it to the ferry in time, so Miles goes after her. He finds her and they race for safety in his parents' car and encounter Laura and Rich on the way. The four head for an open drawbridge, but the car runs out of gas and the tsunami is quickly approaching so they quickly dash into a church and to the roof of the steeple as the tsunami hits and the creatures invade the church. There, the group is reunited with Nimrod and look out upon the completely flooded town, causing Laura to comment that &quot;it is\na new world.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e90d3cb64f32172d1d4595a8438c02c7d5fa65e3","amp;dn":"Surface.S01E15.DVDRip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e90d3cb64f32172d1d4595a8438c02c7d5fa65e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,13,60,182,79,50,23,45,29,69,149,168,67,140,2,199,213,250,101,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
