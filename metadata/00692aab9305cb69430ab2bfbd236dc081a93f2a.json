This recording is one I found on the internet.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nA 19-year-old Hawaiian girl (who would eventually become part of the Saturday Night Fever Soundtrack) and the Australian-American woman (known for singing &quot;I Am Woman&quot;) both have the same song in the countdown. \n\nJerry Reed has the highest debuting song of the week, &quot;When You're Hot, You're Hot&quot; (at number 32).\n\nOn her way to number 1, Carole King moves her song &quot;It's Too Late&quot; up 17 notches from number 38 to number 21.\n\nCasey says he got a letter which asked, &quot;Which song had the biggest drop of any song ever on the Billboard chart?&quot; Casey tells about a 1969 song that fell from number 12 clean off the chart. \n\nThat same letter-writer also asks if Casey is the guy who plays Dexter Carter on ABC's Saturday morning cartoon, &quot;Hot Wheels.&quot; Yes, Casey was the voice of Dexter Carter, and I've included a snippet of that cartoon for you to see. Play it with VLC Media Player, a free download.\n\nMurray Head is at number 14 with his song &quot;Superstar.&quot; He would chart again in 1984 with &quot;One Night In Bangkok.&quot;\n\nFinally, Matthew's Southern Comfort is at number 23 with a song written by Joni Mitchell, &quot;Woodstock.&quot; It would later be remade by Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young, and reach number 11 on Billboard's hot 100. I've included that version as a RocketMan Extra.\n\n40: Lowdown - Chicago\n39: Double Lovin' - The Osmonds\n38: Indian Reservation - The Raiders\n37: Power To The People - Plastic Ono Band\n36: What's Goin' On - Marvin Gaye\n35: I Don't Know How To Love Him - Yvonne Elliman\n34: Me Any My Arrow - Nilsson\n33: Cool-Aid - Paul Humphrey &amp; The Cool-Aid Chemists\n32: When You're Hot, You're Hot - Jerry Reed\n31: The Drum - Bobby Sherman\n30: Timothy - The Buoys\n29: Reach Out, I'll Be There - Diana Ross\n28: I Love You For All Seasons - Fuzz\n27: Nathan Jones - The Supremes\nEXTRA: Runnin' Scared - Roy Orbison\n26: (For God's Sake) Give More Power To The People - The Chi-Lites\n25: I Don't Blame You At All - Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles\n24: Right On The Tip Of My Tongue - Brenda &amp; The Tabulations\n23: Woodstock - Matthew's Southern Comfort\n22: Don't Knock My Love (Part #1) - Wilson Pickett\n21: It's Too Late - Carole King\n20: Toast And Marmalade For Tea - Tin Tin\n19: Treat Her Like A Lady - Cornelius Brothers &amp; Sister Rose\n18: I'll Meet You Halfway - The Partridge Family\n17: Stay Awhile - The Bells\n16: Here Comes The Sun - Richie Havens\n15: I Don't Know How To Love Him - Helen Reddy\n14: Superstar - Murray Head\nEXTRA: Jamie - Eddie Holland\n13: If - Bread\n12: Love Her Madly - The Doors\n11: Rainy Days And Mondays - The Carpenters\n10: Chick-A-Boom - Daddy Dewdrop\n9: Me And You And A Dog Named Boo - Lobo\nEXTRA: Ode To Billy Joe - Bobby Gentry\n8: Sweet And Innocent - Donny Osmond\n7: Bridge Over Troubled Waters - Aretha Franklin\n6: Put Your Hand In The Hand - Ocean\n5: It Don't Come Easy - Ringo Starr\n4: Want Ad - The Honeycomb\n3: Never Can Say Goodbye - The Jackson Five\n2: Joy To The World - Three Dog Night\n1: Brown Sugar - The Rolling Stones\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00692aab9305cb69430ab2bfbd236dc081a93f2a","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1971_May_29th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00692aab9305cb69430ab2bfbd236dc081a93f2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,105,42,171,147,5,203,105,67,10,178,191,189,35,109,192,129,169,63,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
