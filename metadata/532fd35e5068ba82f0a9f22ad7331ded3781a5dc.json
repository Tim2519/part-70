This unique volume brings together both strands in a series of essays written by leading experts in the field of economic development. Topics include measurement issues, micro-behavior determinants of poverty outcomes, economy-wide models in the SAM-CGE tradition and the institutional framework underlying macro policies.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://buspic.com/img/file13879919851.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://buspic.com/img/file13879919851.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:532fd35e5068ba82f0a9f22ad7331ded3781a5dc","amp;dn":"Alain+de+Janvry%2C+Ravi+Kanbur+-+Poverty%2C+Inequality+and+Developme","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"532fd35e5068ba82f0a9f22ad7331ded3781a5dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,47,211,94,80,104,186,130,240,169,242,42,215,51,29,237,55,129,165,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
