But Messaline is built on the ruins of a still more ancient City of Jackals. So when two foreign Wizards and a bard from the mysterious western isles cross the desert in pursuit of a sorcerer intent on plundering the deadly artifacts of lost Erem, Bijou and her companions must join their hunt.\nThe quest will take them through strange passages, beneath the killing light of alien suns, with the price of failure the destruction of every land.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:964f309d021a95d91465b2d983d079c19faed275","amp;dn":"Book+of+Iron+by+Elizabeth+Bear","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"964f309d021a95d91465b2d983d079c19faed275","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,79,48,157,2,26,149,217,20,101,178,217,131,208,121,193,159,174,210,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
