As a bonus, the set comes with an exclusive replica of the original 1969 7-inch single of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Oh Well Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pt. 1Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ b/w Ã¢â‚¬Å“Oh Well Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pt. 2.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nTo ensure superb sound quality, Chris Bellman at Bernie Grundman Mastering cut the lacquers for all four albums. The records look as good as they sound thanks to authentically reproduced packages, including gatefolds for Then Play On and Kiln House and single sleeves for Future Games and Bare Trees. The set follows the band through an early transitional period. With Kiln House, Fleetwood Mac began moving toward a more melodic pop sound on songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mission BellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“One Together.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ At the time, the band included: Jeremy Spencer (guitar, vocals, piano), Kirwan (guitar, vocals), John McVie (bass) and Mick Fleetwood (drums). Christine McVie was at the recording sessions and contributed backing vocals and the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cover art, but she did not join the band until shortly after the album was finished.\nThe bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shift toward pop and folk styles continued on Future Games with songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Show Me A SmileÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Morning Rain.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This marks the first Fleetwood Mac album with Christine McVie as a full band member as well as the Mac debut of Bob Welch on guitar.\nThe line-up stayed the same for Bare Trees, which boasts a consistently strong collection of songs like McVieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Spare Me A Little Of Your Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ KirwanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“DustÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and WelchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sentimental Lady.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Although Kirwan was a dominant figure during the recording, penning half of the songs, this would ultimately be his last appearance on a Fleetwood Mac album.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d1e03f93cff7372c55cf59548a5dc21619caafa","amp;dn":"Fleetwood+Mac+-+Fleetwood+Mac+1969+to+1972+%5BVinyl+Box+Set%5D+%282013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d1e03f93cff7372c55cf59548a5dc21619caafa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,30,3,249,60,255,115,114,197,92,245,149,72,165,220,33,97,156,170,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
