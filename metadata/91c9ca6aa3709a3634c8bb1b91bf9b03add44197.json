Cooke - Bass\n\n\nBlues rocker Bob &quot;Catfish&quot; Hodge was born and raised in Detroit, and as a teen frequently snuck into Motown Records' Hitsville studio to catch sessions featuring the Four Tops, the Supremes and others. At the end of the 1960s he formed the band Catfish, debuting in 1970 with Get Down; after issuing Live Catfish a year later, Hodge mounted a solo career with 1973's Boogie Man I Gonna Get Ya, relocating to Washington D.C. and becoming a regular opening act for artists including Bonnie Raitt and Little Feat. After a series of solo LPs including 1974's Dinosaurs and Alleycats, 1975's Sop Operas and 1979's Eyewitness Blues, he toured with the Chicken Legs Band during the early 1980s, relocating to California in 1982 and later forming the Bluesbusters with onetime Little Feat guitarist Paul Barrere. After a long absence from the studio, Hodge returned to action in 1994 with Catfish Blues; Like a Big Dog Barkin' followed a year later, and in 1996 he resurfaced with Adventures at Catfish Pond. ~ Jason Ankeny, Rovi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91c9ca6aa3709a3634c8bb1b91bf9b03add44197","amp;dn":"Catfish+-+Get+Down+%281970%29+%5BWAV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91c9ca6aa3709a3634c8bb1b91bf9b03add44197","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,201,202,106,163,112,154,54,52,200,187,27,145,191,155,3,173,212,65,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
