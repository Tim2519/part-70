Mathieu\n\n.: Plot :.\nFast N' Loud follows motor mastermind Richard Rawlings and mechanical whiz kid Aaron Kaufmann as they search the far flung corners of Texas and beyond for beat-up, classic cars they can buy and restore at their home base, Gas Monkey Garage, in Dallas. While 'in Rome,' they'll fall in with the local customs and characters - an all American road trip with full throttle attitude. Ultimately, Richard and Aaron will do whatever it takes to finish their cars and make auction. But will their blood, sweat and beers translate into cold hard cash? \n\nAs far back as the 1950s, America has been a virtual graveyard of classic cars. Across the country, vintage vehicles can be found rusting in overgrown fields, abandoned back lots, and musty garages. From '57 Chevys to '73 Trans Ams, these machines are screaming to be brought back to life. To most they're just rust buckets, but to Rawlings and his crew they're a goldmine waiting to be excavated. In fact, that's their specialty: they turn rust into gold.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c500a258da66cc59e477c2a91ac8ab4bebaa32e6","amp;dn":"Fast.N.Loud.S04E06-E12.HDTV.x264-KILLERS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c500a258da66cc59e477c2a91ac8ab4bebaa32e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,0,162,88,218,102,204,89,228,119,194,169,26,200,171,75,235,170,50,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
