Although Miller ultimately finished in ninth place on The X Factor, she left with a huge number of fans and supporters. Very quickly, she signed with Hollywood Records and began recording her debut. Working with producer/songwriters Mick Schultz (Jeremih, Zendaya), Busbee (Shakira, P!nk), Mike Del Rio (Christina Aguilera), and Jarrad Rogers (Demi Lovato, Lana Del Rey), Miller crafted this four-song EP of high-energy, passionate, big-hearted rock that finds a balance between Paramore and Katy Perry. Along with the title track single are the songs &quot;Enemy Fire,&quot; &quot;Fire n' Gold,&quot; and the hip-hop-inflected &quot;Dracula.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fe54a2b4aa4aacc4869c7b1f8ed064e8f324630","amp;dn":"Young+Blood+-+EP+Bea+Miller+%2B+Rich+Kids+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fe54a2b4aa4aacc4869c7b1f8ed064e8f324630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,229,74,43,74,164,170,204,72,105,199,177,248,237,6,78,143,50,70,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
