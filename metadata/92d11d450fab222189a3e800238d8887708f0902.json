It stars Shirley Temple and Jack Oakie\n\nIn 1940, Shirley Temple had two box-office flops in a row - The Blue Bird and Young People. She was 12 years old, but her contract said she was 11 so she could have a longer onscreen childhood. As a result of these two financial failures, Temple was no longer a top box-office star and her contract with Twentieth-Century-Fox was terminated.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Shirley Temple as Wendy Ballantine\n    Jack Oakie as Joe Ballentine\n    Charlotte Greenwood as Kit Ballentine\n    Arleen Whelan as Judith\n    George Montgomery as Mike Shea\n\nDirected by Allan Dwan\nMusic by Harry Warren, Mack Gordon\n\nBelieving that it's good for their daughter Wendy (Shirley Temple), Joe Ballantine (Jack Oakie) and his wife Kit (Charlotte Greenwood) decide to retire their vaudeville act and move the family to a small New England town. But despite Wendy's many attempts to charm the locals, the &quot;show folk&quot; are given the cold shoulder. That is, until a hurricane hits the town, and because of the generosity, strength and conviction in the face of disaster, it appears that the troupers just might win over the residents in their new hometown after all.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4999 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English, Spanish\nRunTime 79 mins\nSubtitles: English, Espanol, Francais\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 79 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92d11d450fab222189a3e800238d8887708f0902","amp;dn":"Young+People+%281940%29+DVD5+-+Shirley+Temple+Films+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92d11d450fab222189a3e800238d8887708f0902","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,209,29,69,15,171,34,33,137,163,232,0,35,141,136,135,112,143,9,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
