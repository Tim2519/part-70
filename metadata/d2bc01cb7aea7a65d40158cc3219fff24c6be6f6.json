It recounts quite poetically the story of a peasant uprising on an estate in Hungary in the 1890s. It examines the nature of revolt, and the issues of morality and violence. This film uses symbolic imagery and language involving the color red to great effect and was filmed in a virtuoso manner, using only 28 shots. Reviewers reported that Jancso's storytelling technique most closely resembled that used in ballet. The pacifistic peasants, who seek some basic rights, are in a standoff with local authorities and later, the army. Everyone takes a break in the confrontation in order to celebrate a festival. Afterwards, the peasants resume their strike and meet with a tragic end.\n\n\nLanguage: Hungarian / English\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2bc01cb7aea7a65d40158cc3219fff24c6be6f6","amp;dn":"Meg+Ker+A+Nep+aka+Red+Psalm+1972+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2bc01cb7aea7a65d40158cc3219fff24c6be6f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,188,1,203,122,234,122,101,212,1,88,204,50,25,255,242,76,107,230,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
