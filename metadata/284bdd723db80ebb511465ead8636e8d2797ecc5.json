Plus, Nelson Mandela's Dark History. These With John B. Wells of Coast To Coast As Today's Special Co-host.\n\nOn this Wednesday, December 11 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Coast to Coast AM radio host John B. Wells joins Alex in studio to co-host and debunk the latest lies used to excuse corruption flowing within all levels of government. \n\nU.S. lawmakers are once again exaggerating the threat of Iran and North Korea in order to give billions in contracts to the military-industrial complex. \n\nOn the state level, the Sonoma Co. sheriff's deputy who gunned down a 13-year-old for holding an air soft rifle is now back on duty only six weeks after the lethal shooting. The boy, Andy Lopez, was shot seven times.\n\nToday's broadcast went 50 minutes into a 4th hour &quot;overdrive.&quot;\n\nThis upload is the Prison Planet &quot;members' edit&quot; -- the whole broadcast in one .MP3 with scheduled commercial breaks taken out.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
