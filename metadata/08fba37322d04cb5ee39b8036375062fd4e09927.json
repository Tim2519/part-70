After these two albums they changed the name from Mullmuzzler to James LaBrie. These are 5 great albums and some of the many side projects of Progressive Metal band Dream Theater.\n\nIn my opinion, these albums sound a lot like Dream Theater but more of a radio friendly approach than a progressive setup. I really like these albums and James LaBrie's talent is heard in them. It's very emotional and moving and it has a very unique theme.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08fba37322d04cb5ee39b8036375062fd4e09927","amp;dn":"James+LaBrie+Solo+Albums+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08fba37322d04cb5ee39b8036375062fd4e09927","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,251,163,115,34,208,76,181,238,57,184,3,99,117,6,47,212,224,153,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
