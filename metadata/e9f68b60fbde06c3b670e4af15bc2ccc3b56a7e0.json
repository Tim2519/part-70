This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What has been the biggest remake in the rock era?&quot; It turns out to be a song which was actually recorded before the first hit version. Casey clears up the confusion.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1980, only two artists have been able to put a hit in the top 40 every year. One is Paul McCartney. Casey spotlights the other.\n\nIn honor of &quot;De Do Do Do De Da Da Da&quot; (by The Police at number 19), Casey says the AT40 staff has found 54 songs that have hit the top 40 in the rock era with nonsensical titles, and names a few.\n\nIn the entire rock era, only seven people have managed to hit the top 40 more than 40 times. There is one woman among them, and she has a song in this countdown. Casey gives the details.\n\nLW#3: The Wanderer - Donna Summer\nLW#2: Woman In Love - Barbra Streisand\nLW#1: Lady - Kenny Rogers\n40: I Love A Rainy Night - Eddie Rabbitt\n39: I Made It Through The Night - Barry Manilow\n38: Time Is Time - Andy Gibb\n37: Let Me Be Your Angel - Stacy Lattisaw\n36: Girls Can Get It - Dr. Hook\n35: Lovely One - The Jacksons\n34: One Step Closer - Doobie Brothers\nLDD: A Place In The Sun - Stevie Wonder\n33: Never Knew Love Like This Before - Stephanie Mills\nARCHIVE: He's So Fine - The Chiffons\n32: The Tide Is High - Blondie\n31: Passion - Rod Stewart\n30: Suddenly - Olivia Newton-John and Cliff Richard\n29: I Believe In You - Don Williams\n28: Celebration - Kool &amp; The Gang\n27: This Time - John Cougar\nEXTRA: Crocodile Rock - Elton John\n26: He's So Shy - The Pointer Sisters\n25: Sequel - Harry Chapin\n24: Theme From &quot;The Dukes Of Hazzard&quot; - Waylon Jennings\nARCHIVE: I Will Follow Him - Little Peggy March\n23: It's My Turn - Diana Ross\n22: Deep Inside My Heart - Randy Meisner\n21: Everybody's Got To Learn Sometime - The Korgis\n20: Without Your Love - Roger Daltry\n19: De Do Do Do De Da Da Da - The Police\n18: Tell It Like It Is - Heart\n17: Whip It - Devo\n16: Every Woman In The World - Air Supply\n15: Never Be The Same - Christopher Cross\n14: Guilty - Barbra Streisand and Barry Gibb\n13: The Wanderer - Donna Summer\nARCHIVE: If You Wanna Be Happy - Jimmy Soul\n12: You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n11: Hit Me With Your Best Shot - Pat Benetar\n10: Dreaming - Cliff Richard\n9: I'm Coming Out - Diana Ross\n8: Hungry Heart - Bruce Springsteen\n7: Love On The Rocks - Neil Diamond\n6: (Just Like) Starting Over - John Lennon\nLDD: Ready To Take A Chance Again - Barry Manilow\n5: Master Blaster - Stevie Wonder\n4: Woman In Love - Barbra Streisand\n3: Another One Bites The Dust - Queen\n2: More Than I Can Say - Leo Sayer\n1: Lady - Kenny Rogers\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9f68b60fbde06c3b670e4af15bc2ccc3b56a7e0","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1980_December_6th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9f68b60fbde06c3b670e4af15bc2ccc3b56a7e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,246,139,96,251,222,6,195,182,112,228,175,21,188,44,204,59,86,167,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
