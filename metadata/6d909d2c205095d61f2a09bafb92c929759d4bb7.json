Billy Crudup plays William Bloom, a young man who never really knew his dying father, Edward (Albert Finney) outside of the tall tales he told about growing up, making his way, and meeting his mother (played as a young woman by Alison Lohman and in older age by Jessica Lange). During Edward's last days, William and his wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) hold bedside vigil as the old man recollects elaborate memories of his youth (in which he is played by Ewan McGregor). Still doubting the the legends and folklore, William makes a journey to meet a mysterious woman (Helena Bonham Carter) from whom Edward had bought property. Steve Buscemi and Danny De Vito also star. ~ Andrea LeVasseur, Rovi\n\nBROUGHT TO YOU BY CLOWNSEC * HONK *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d909d2c205095d61f2a09bafb92c929759d4bb7","amp;dn":"Big+Fish+%282003%29++720p+BrRip+x264+-+CLOWNSEC+%28PhreakyFlix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d909d2c205095d61f2a09bafb92c929759d4bb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,144,157,44,32,80,149,214,31,42,9,186,251,146,201,41,117,157,75,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
