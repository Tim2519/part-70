Larry doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sugar-coat, and he isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afraid to make people uncomfortable, because he wants us to stop making excuses, and start getting results. \nIn Grow a Pair, Larry takes on entitlement culture, the self-help movement, political correctness, and more. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve all heard the phrase Ã¢â‚¬Å“grow a pair,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but LarryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advice isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t about anatomyÃ¢â‚¬â€ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about attitude. To get the success we want, we need to reject victimhood in favor of being assertive and finally taking some responsibility. \nWith prescriptive advice on goal achieving, career, personal finance, and more, Grow a Pair will give the readers the kick in the pants they need.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68a8750cb607934c56736b495115b2d79af3b277","amp;dn":"Grow+a+Pair+by+Larry+Winget","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68a8750cb607934c56736b495115b2d79af3b277","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,168,117,12,182,7,147,76,86,115,107,73,81,21,178,215,154,243,178,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
