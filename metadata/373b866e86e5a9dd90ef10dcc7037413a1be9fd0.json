Yesterday, Knight and the crew interviewed consumers who had been waiting outside a local Best Buy since before dawn on Thanksgiving. Media analyst and political activist Mark Dice joins the broadcast to discuss his latest video in which he dressed up as Santa Claus and bullhorned shoppers who spent Thanksgiving waiting outside stores instead of being with their families at home. Paul Joseph Watson and Anthony Gucciardi also give their take on this zombie takeover of America.\n\nThis upload is the Prison Planet &quot;members' edit,&quot; which has the commercials during scheduled breaks removed and the entire show in one MP3 file.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
