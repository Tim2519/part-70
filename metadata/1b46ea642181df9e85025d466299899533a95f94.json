He has a 17-year-old son named Gi-Hyuk (Lee Min-Ho), which he raises by himself. Gi-Hyuk is a smart kid, but troubled. The father and the son also do not get along. Although, Jong-Woo might appear like an irresponsible father, he tries his best and even works at night as a private taxi service. One evening, Jong-Woo drops off a couple at a ritzy hotel. Suddenly, another man hops into Jong-Woo's car and tells him to drive off. Once the man pulls out large stash of cash, Jong-Woo is happy to drive the man wherever he wants. The man asks Jong-Woo to drive him to a delivery company. Jong-Woo walks into the delivery company and asks for directions to the bathroom. He then notices the man mailing off a small electronic device. The man then comes up to Jong-Woo and offers him $1,000 if he will drive him to an apartment and then to the airport. Jong-Woo happily agrees, but he first grabs the man's cellphone and calls his own cellphone. Once they get into the parking garage of the apartment complex, Jong-Woo's life is about to turn completely upside down. He runs out of the garage on foot and becomes the prime suspect in a murder case. Meanwhile, Gi-Hyuk is shocked and confused that his father is now a murder suspect. Gi-Hyuk attempts to uncover the truth.\n\n\nVideo Codec.......: x264\nVideo Format......: MPEG-4\nFile Size.........: 791 MiB\nRuntime...........: 2hr 7min\nResolution........: 720x480 (3:2)\nFrame Rate........: 23.976 fps\nBit rate..........: 768 Kbps\n\n\nAudio Language....: English, AAC-LC, 2CH, 96 Kbps\nCompression mode..: Lossy\nSampling rate.....: 44.1 KHz\nBit depth.........: 16 bits\n\n\n*************************************************************\n\n\t\tEncoded By: SaRGN\n\n*************************************************************\n\n\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nimplus.com/viewer.php?file=43242463768737814640.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nimplus.com/viewer.php?file=43242463768737814640.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nimplus.com/viewer.php?file=88222058155649635175.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nimplus.com/viewer.php?file=88222058155649635175.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nimplus.com/viewer.php?file=12667582171798033255.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nimplus.com/viewer.php?file=12667582171798033255.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nimplus.com/viewer.php?file=06974288663901774697.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nimplus.com/viewer.php?file=06974288663901774697.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nimplus.com/viewer.php?file=88098173424231755086.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nimplus.com/viewer.php?file=88098173424231755086.jpeg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b46ea642181df9e85025d466299899533a95f94","amp;dn":"Running+Man+%282013%29+480p+BluRay+AAC-LC+x264-SaRGN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b46ea642181df9e85025d466299899533a95f94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,70,234,100,33,129,223,158,133,2,93,70,98,153,137,149,51,169,95,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
