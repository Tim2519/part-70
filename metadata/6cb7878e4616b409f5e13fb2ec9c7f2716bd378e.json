X. Durrwell, C.Ss.R. Though his work is mostly ignored today, these two books were important when published shortly before Vatican II. The first re-established the centrality of the Resurrection in Christian faith and life; the second extended these insights into the area of spirituality.\n\n\n--The Resurrection: A Biblical Study (Sheed &amp; Ward, 1960). 371 pages.\n\nThis is a reprocessed version of the pdf scan fromas such it's not perfect, but it's reasonably good.\n\n\n--In the Redeeming Christ (Sheed &amp; Ward, 1963). 365 pages.\n\nNew scan.\n\nAt the beginning of &quot;In the Redeeming Christ,&quot; priest and theologian F. X. Durrwell states that &quot;The Christian's salvation lies in his personal sanctification. There too lies the salvation of others.&quot; Durrwell's classic offers a hopeful and lucid vision of the Christian spiritual life to inspire and teach readers about the mystery of living in personal holiness - and most truly themselves - by being &quot;in Christ&quot; as a member his body. Durrwell builds on the foundation of the great scriptural and liturgical reforms of the early twentieth century, crafting surprising and inspiring connections between the paschal mystery, the sacraments, our personal Christian lives, and the healing of the world. He paints a picture of the faith as something deeply personal and of universal significance.
