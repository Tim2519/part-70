Friends since preschool, Evan Hailstone and Quinn Mulligan have been creating music together since the age of 15. Growing up together with a love for classic rock, the two continued to play in bands together until college, where they met drummer Dane Brist (Hailstone was actually Brist's RA) who shared their love of film and music. While the trio has seen several incarnations with members manning different rolls, 2009 saw the final line up of the band, who chose the name Fanno Creek after the creek where Mulligan and Hailstone played together as children.
