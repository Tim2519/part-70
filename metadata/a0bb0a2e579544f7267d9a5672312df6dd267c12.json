Welcome to Rokkenjima (Six eaves island).\n\nFall 1986... in Rokkenjima, a private island owned by Kinzou Ushiromiya, eleven of his relatives arrive for a family reunion. He is dying and children want nothing more than to split the wealth he will leave behind. But as a storm traps them on the island, the riddle of Rokkenjima's legendary golden witch begins to take the lives of several people. Who can solve the riddle and gain the gold &amp; the inheritance? Will the golden witch truly revive?\n\nNote: The story is divided into episodes: four &quot;Question&quot; arcs. Each episode keeps the same main characters, but ends in a different way. However, each episode gives valuable answers, hints, and clues to the previous one, while at the same time bringing forth even more mysteries.\nThe question arcs are: Legend of the golden witch, Turn of the golden witch, Banquet of the golden witch, and Alliance of the golden witch.\n\nInfo source: MU\nDownload source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0bb0a2e579544f7267d9a5672312df6dd267c12","amp;dn":"Umineko+no+Naku+Koro+ni+-+Episode+02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0bb0a2e579544f7267d9a5672312df6dd267c12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,187,10,46,87,149,68,247,38,125,154,86,114,49,45,246,221,38,124,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
