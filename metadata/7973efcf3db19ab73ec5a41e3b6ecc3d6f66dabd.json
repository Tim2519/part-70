Or was Jesus such a shadowy figure - far removed from any credible historical evidence - that he bears no meaningful resemblance to the person described in the Bible?\n\nIn Did Jesus Exist? historian and Bible expert Bart Ehrman confronts these questions, vigorously defends the historicity of Jesus, and provides a compelling portrait of the man from Nazareth. The Jesus you discover here may not be the Jesus you had hoped to meet - but he did exist, whether we like it or not.\n\nAudible Audio Edition\nListening Length: 11 hours and 59 minutes\nProgram Type: Audiobook\nVersion: Unabridged\nPublisher: HarperAudio\nAudible.com Release Date: July 10, 2012\nWhispersync for Voice: Ready\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B008J9FFQ8\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
