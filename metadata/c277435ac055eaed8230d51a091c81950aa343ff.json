The book also provides an introduction to the use of Lie symmetry group methods for diffusions, which allows to compute a wide range of functionals. Besides the well-known methodology on affine diffusions it presents a novel approach to affine processes with applications in finance. Numerical methods, including Monte Carlo and quadrature methods, are discussed together with supporting material on stochastic processes. Applications in finance, for instance, on credit risk and credit valuation adjustment are included in the book. The functionals of multidimensional diffusions analyzed in this book are significant for many areas of application beyond finance. The book is aimed at a wide readership, and develops an intuitive and rigorous understanding of the mathematics underlying the derivation of explicit formulas for functionals of multidimensional diffusions.Ã¢â‚¬â€¹\n\nContent Level Ã‚Â» Research\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c277435ac055eaed8230d51a091c81950aa343ff","amp;dn":"Functionals+of+Multidimensional+Diffusions+with+Applications+to+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c277435ac055eaed8230d51a091c81950aa343ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,119,67,90,192,85,234,237,130,48,213,26,9,28,129,149,10,163,67,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
