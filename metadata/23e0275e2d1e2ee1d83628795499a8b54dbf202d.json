Take your quinine, malaria is rampant. Make do: supplies will not arrive. Stay strong, despite the overwhelming odds.\n\nand from IMDB\n\n  &quot;The Army nurses on Bataan need help badly, but when it arrives, it sure isn't what they expected. A motley crew, including a Southern belle, a waitress, and a stripper, show up. Many conflicts arise among these women who are thrown together in what is a desperate and ultimately hopeless situation.\n- Written by &quot; \n\n  My notes\n\n  The distinguishing feature of this WWII film is that all of the \nfeatured players are women and they all give their best.  Joan Blondell from\nmusicals is seen here in a dramatic role.  Ann (Foxy MacNamara) Sothern plays a darker role than she did on television in The Ann Sothern Show.  And there's Ella Rains whose &quot;Somewhere In The Night&quot; is one of the best noirs made.  I first saw Francis Gifford in an Alan Ladd picture.  She had maybe three lines as a nurse.  But I didn't forget that scene.  They are all here playing mature women's roles in a war-time setting.\n\n  The torrent is given because I have not seen it elsewhere on any index.
