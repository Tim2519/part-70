Those are other reasons for people to embrace the ACA, and for Republicans to fear it. Having affordable and available healthcare is vital to economic opportunity. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make a living while spending all of your time and energy just living.\n\nThe next Republican attack on Obamacare is that you are not going to be able to keep your doctor. If you were wondering if that is true, well, Darrell Issa is launching hearings about it, so you know just from that that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s BS. I assume that only a very, very few people are actually going to end up losing their doctor. And every one of those people is going to end up on Fox News.\n\nRush Limbaugh is speaking out about obesity. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to hear about obesity from Rush unless itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a confessional. Rush claims that food stamp programs cause obesity. The only way I would believe that is if Rush revealed that he himself subsists solely on food stamps.\n\nRush is quoting a story from the Washington Times. The Washington Times is to journalistic integrity in print what Rush Limbaugh is to journalistic integrity on the radio. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nice to see that Rush and the Washington Times are sharing dis-information. Why should rightwingers each have to come up with their own set of lies? Rush identifies the Washington Times as source Ã¢â‚¬Å“just to show you I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t making it up.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ No, somebody else was making it up this time. Rush says the article links obesity to food stamps, which he says Ã¢â‚¬Å“makes total sense.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ You have to remember that, to Rush, making total sense means fitting in perfectly with his racist view of the world.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being reported that Pope Francis sneaks out of the Vatican at night and goes around Rome helping poor people. Fascinating. I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be surprised if Rush Limbaugh spends his nights wandering poor neighborhoods and stealing stuff out of the shopping carts of homeless people. OK, Rush would never do that. No. He probably sends his housekeeper out to do it. He makes her come back with a quota of stolen shopping carts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:487062376f2ffefbb0e7936182ed4a99fb0a90ed","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+December+04+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"487062376f2ffefbb0e7936182ed4a99fb0a90ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,112,98,55,111,47,254,251,176,231,147,97,130,237,74,153,251,10,144,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
