This now contains the audio for the intro, intermission and exit films and the B-set songs sequenced in the proper places in the setlist.  The only exception is Limelight because the band chose to provide us with a soundcheck version where all the vocals aren't sung.  I searched low and high for a soundboard bootleg from the tour that I could isolate the vocals from and paste them over the soundcheck, but I could not locate one.  Consequently this song remains as a bonus track.\n\n01 intro film\n02 Subdivisions\n03 The Big Money\n04 Force Ten\n05 Grand Designs\n06 Middletown Dreams\n07 The Body Electric\n08 Territories\n09 The Analog Kid\n10 Bravado\n11 The Pass\n12 Where's My Thing?/Here It Is!
