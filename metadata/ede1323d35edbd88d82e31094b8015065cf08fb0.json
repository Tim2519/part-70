In order to keep her promise, an afternoon favor turns into a weekend of startling but undeniable attraction, threatening the well-ordered world that keeps her heart at armÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s length from any more pain.\n\nSamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan is to fly to Livingston, Montana, take vows for his favorite cousin, and return to Chicago as quickly as possible. But his plan is turned upside-down when he must spend a weekend with Jenny in Gardiner in order to keep his word. He doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to fall for the prim, proper schoolteacher whose small-town life seems to him like selling out, but the more time he spends with her, the harder it is to say good-bye.\n\nWhen city and country come together for Christmas, the unexpected gift is true love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ede1323d35edbd88d82e31094b8015065cf08fb0","amp;dn":"By+Proxy+by+Katy+Regnery","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ede1323d35edbd88d82e31094b8015065cf08fb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,225,50,61,53,237,189,136,216,46,49,9,75,128,21,6,92,240,143,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
