I wanted to give back :)\n\nPhotoshop seems to be very popular..\nAt the same time.. i also wanted to design a new Portable version for myself..\n\nI used to run PortableXApps, thus have created multiple PhotoshopPortable versions..\nBut they were all bloated, and very slow.. due to all the features..\n\nThis time.. i wanted something lite, fast, reliable, simplistic, but with enough features to suffice a casual user.\n\nAnd design with PAF format, so end-users can edit, add, or see the coding.\n\nWhat did i strip out?\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ DynamicLink\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Creative Cloud\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Updating\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ PDF Admin\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ SL Store\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Online Access\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Kuler\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Extensions\n\nWhat is PAF format?\n- not virtualized\n- runs naturally, as if installed\n- able to utilize your PC's hardware. ie. CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.\n- Plugins, addons, etc.. are possible.\n\nHow to edit, customize, or add Plugins? //bayimg.com/HAeHMaafG\n\nThoroughly Tested:\nChinese: //bayimg.com/haehlAAFg\nSpanish: //bayimg.com/haehNAAfg\nRussian: //bayimg.com/IAEHaAafG\nWindows 8: //bayimg.com/IaEhBaAfg\n\n\nNote: before using.. i highly recommend reading &quot;Help.html&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76b9ca8352654f5c0037be09db94afd6cbd4f40c","amp;dn":"Adobe+Photoshop+CC+Lite+Portable+%2814.1.2%29+%28PAF+Format%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76b9ca8352654f5c0037be09db94afd6cbd4f40c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,185,202,131,82,101,79,92,0,55,190,9,219,148,175,214,203,212,244,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
