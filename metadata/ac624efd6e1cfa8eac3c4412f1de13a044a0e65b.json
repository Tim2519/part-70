To do this in a more relaxed manner and without a lot of responsibility , the musical producer and researcher Marcelo Froes has met with many national artists and bands of different styles and origins - anonymous and famous - for their own versions of what the quartet has produced in recent years of activity.\n\nAfter the first volume, the second album &quot;Beatles '70&quot; reports the production that marked the end of the Beatles, with songs of the early members struggling with their solo albums. Here are the highlights with &quot;Instant Karma&quot; by LobÃƒÂ£o, &quot;Mother&quot; by Zeca Baleiro and &quot;Beware Of darkenss&quot; ZÃƒÂ© Ramalho. Another song that deserves to be mentioned is definitely the version of &quot;Isolation&quot;, offered by the brilliant Twiggy.\n\nThe disc is not only for fans and should appeal even to those who do not know so thoroughly the work of &quot; lads from Liverpool .&quot; After all , the tracks left us by the Beatles have become classics and it is very interesting to hear these different Brazilian artists sing this tribute .\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac624efd6e1cfa8eac3c4412f1de13a044a0e65b","amp;dn":"Various+Artists+Beatles+%2770+Vol.2+%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac624efd6e1cfa8eac3c4412f1de13a044a0e65b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,98,78,253,110,28,250,142,172,60,68,18,241,222,19,160,68,160,230,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
