We're always at number one.&quot; - Mike Eiland (AT40 the 70's host for WODC Columbus 5/25/2014)\n\n\nThis is a show that never existed. It came about due to some creative editing performed by Ken Martin (Program Director at WTOJ - Magic 103.1 in Carthage, New York).\n\nExpect four more parts, probably coming out around upcoming US holiday weekends (July 4th, September 1st, and then we will see after that).\n\nNot many stations carried this special (see this forum) http://at40fg.proboards.com/thread/3958/stations-carrying-hits-special-countdown\n\nIt was for this reason I left in the station identification. WODC in Columbus, Ohio (and their AT40 advocating host Mike Eiland) never lets an AT40 fan down, playing both 70's programs when Premire releases and 'A' and a 'B' show, and playing all four hours of 70's recordings that were done in a four-hour format (October 7th, 1978 forward).\n\n\nRaindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head - B.J.
