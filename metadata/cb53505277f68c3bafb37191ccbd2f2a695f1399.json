There are actually two of them in this \nfilm, mates who finally get together (after the traditional destruction of various Japanese cities) and die in an oddly touching lovers' \ndeath-swoon into an active volcano. The film's best sequence is the chilling opening, in which Rodan's egg is discovered in a cave by \ndoomed miners.\n\nRodan, released in Japan as Sora no Daikaiju Radon (&quot;Radon, Giant Monster of the Sky&quot;), is a 1956 Kaiju film produced by Toho Studios. It \nwas the studio's first Kaiju movie filmed in color (though Toho's first color tokusatsu film, Madame White Snake, was released earlier \nthat year). It is one of a series of &quot;giant monster&quot; movies that found an audience outside Japan, especially in the United States, where \nit was originally released as Rodan!
