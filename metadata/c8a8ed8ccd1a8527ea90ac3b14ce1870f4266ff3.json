The guitars ring as if they were recorded in the late '80s, but it has a muscular backbone, and vocalist Cerys Matthews has a tough edge to her voice, which never makes the music sound weak. And a good majority of the songs -- from &quot;Sweet Catatonia&quot; and &quot;You've Got a Lot to Answer For&quot; to &quot;Painful&quot; and &quot;Way Beyond Blue&quot; -- are excellent, shimmering pop gems, making it an impressive debut.
