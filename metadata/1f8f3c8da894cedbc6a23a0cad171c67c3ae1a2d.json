The franchise mainly focuses on the fictional character Jason Voorhees, who drowned as a boy at Camp Crystal Lake due to the negligence of the camp staff. Decades later, the lake is rumored to be &quot;cursed&quot; and is the setting for a series of mass murders. Jason is featured in all of the films, as either the killer or the motivation for the killings. The original film was written by Victor Miller and was produced and directed by Sean S. Cunningham. However, neither returned to write or direct any of the sequels.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f8f3c8da894cedbc6a23a0cad171c67c3ae1a2d","amp;dn":"friday+the+13th+%281-12%29+%28greek+encoded+subtitles+by+hristoforos%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f8f3c8da894cedbc6a23a0cad171c67c3ae1a2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,143,60,141,168,148,206,219,198,162,58,12,173,23,28,103,195,174,26,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
