The objects are discovered to be spacecraft containing hostile extraterrestrial life. Marines from Camp Pendleton arrive in Los Angeles, including SSgt. Michael Nantz, a 20-year veteran who had lost his squad during his tour in Iraq. Nantz was officially to begin his retirement; but because of the attack, is instead made the acting platoon sergeant for a Marine infantry platoon. Under the command of 2nd Lt. William Martinez, the platoon arrives at Santa Monica Airport, now a Forward Operating Base. The alien ground forces have no apparent air support, as the Air Force prepares to carpet bomb the Santa Monica area. The platoon is tasked with rescuing civilians from an LAPD police station in West Los Angeles before the bombing. As they advance through the city, they are ambushed and suffer casualties. A group of Army National Guard soldiers from the 40th Infantry Division, and an Air Force intelligence TSgt., Elena Santos, having escaped hostile action that killed their comrades, now team up with the platoon. At the police station, the platoon finds five civilians: veterinarian Michele, children Hector Rincon, Kirsten, Amy, and Hector's father Joe.\n\n--------------------------\n--------------------------\n\n Cheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a75c72951e2e682592649d9b9b2e98f887352502","amp;dn":"Battle+Los+Angeles+%282011%29+%5B720p%2C+AVI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a75c72951e2e682592649d9b9b2e98f887352502","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,92,114,149,30,46,104,37,146,100,157,155,155,46,152,248,135,53,37,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
