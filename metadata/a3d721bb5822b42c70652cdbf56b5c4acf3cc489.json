Soldiers were often unceremoniously dumped in a mass grave; officers shipped home for burial.\n\n\nThe great cemeteries of WWI came about as a result of the efforts of one inspired visionary. In 1914, Fabian Ware joined the Red Cross, working on the frontline in France. Horrified by the hasty burials, he recorded the identity and position of the graves. His work was officially recognised, with a Graves Registration Commission being set up. As reports of their work became public, the Commission was flooded with letters from grieving relatives around the world.\n\n\nCritically acclaimed author David Crane gives a profoundly moving account of the creation of the great citadels to the dead, which involved leading figures of the day, including Rudyard Kipling. It is the story of cynical politicking, as governments sought to justify the sacrifice, as well as the grief of nations, following the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœwar to end all warsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2013/11/19/1384881553701/Thiepval-Memorial-and-War-009.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2013/11/19/1384881553701/Thiepval-Memorial-and-War-009.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAbout the Author :-\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/GUARDIAN/Pix/pictures/2013/10/31/1383240768427/David-Crane-008.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/GUARDIAN/Pix/pictures/2013/10/31/1383240768427/David-Crane-008.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDavid Crane's first book, Ã¢â‚¬ËœLord ByronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s JackalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was published to great acclaim in 1998, and his second, Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Kindness of SistersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ published in 2002, is a groundbreaking work of romantic biography.
