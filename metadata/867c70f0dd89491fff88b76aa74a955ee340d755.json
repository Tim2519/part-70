But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s simply not true, as Olivia Fox Cabane reveals. Charismatic behaviors can be learned and perfected by anyone.\n \nDrawing on techniques she originally developed for Harvard and MIT, Cabane breaks charisma down into its components. Becoming more charismatic doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean transforming your fundamental personality. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about adopting a series of specific practices that fit in with the personality you already have.\n \nThe Charisma Myth shows you how to become more influential, more persuasive, and more inspiring.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:867c70f0dd89491fff88b76aa74a955ee340d755","amp;dn":"The+Charisma+Myth%3A+How+Anyone+Can+Master+the+Art+and+Science+of+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"867c70f0dd89491fff88b76aa74a955ee340d755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,124,112,240,221,137,73,31,255,136,183,106,167,74,149,94,227,64,215,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
