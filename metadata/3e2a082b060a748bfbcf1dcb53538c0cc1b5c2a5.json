Music along the lines of At The Drive In or Hellbender. \n\nIn OGG variable and mp3 @ 320k","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e2a082b060a748bfbcf1dcb53538c0cc1b5c2a5","amp;dn":"Trans+Megetti+-+Steal+the+Jet+Keys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e2a082b060a748bfbcf1dcb53538c0cc1b5c2a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,42,8,43,6,10,116,139,251,207,29,203,83,83,140,12,193,181,194,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
