At turns shocking, provocative, and heart-wrenching, and inspired by a true story The Whole Golden World forces us to ask the question &quot;How well do we really know our children?&quot;\n\nTo the outside Dinah and Joe have a perfect family-three lovely children, a beautiful home, and a cafÃƒÂ© that's finally taking off. But their world is rocked when it's discovered that their oldest daughter, 17-year-old Morgan is having an affair with her married teacher, TJ Hill.\n\nTheir town rocks with the scandal. When the case goes to trial, the family is torn further apart when Morgan sides not with her parents-as a manipulated teenage girl; but with TJ himself-as a woman who loves a 30-year-old man.\n\nTold from the perspectives of Morgan, Dinah, and TJ's wife, Rain, this is an unforgettable story that fully explores the surprising, even shocking, events that change the lives of two families.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6a7a1bae9a07c839d730b97772d618a3abf4ac8","amp;dn":"The+Whole+Golden+World+-+Kristina+Riggle.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6a7a1bae9a07c839d730b97772d618a3abf4ac8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,167,161,186,233,160,124,131,157,115,11,151,119,45,97,138,58,191,74,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
