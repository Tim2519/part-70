For seventeen centuries the scroll lay hidden away in the vast Vatican archives, guarded by a select, ruthless few who knew of its destructive potentialÃ¢â‚¬â€and would swiftly kill to contain its secrets.\n\nWhen the parchment mysteriously turns up in the stall of a murdered Cairo market trader, authorities contact the British for assistance in identifying the document. Police detective Chris Bronson and historian Angela Lewis arrive in Egypt to take on the case, but quickly find themselves as targets, pursued by assassins. Stalked across North Africa and Europe, Chris and Angela must decipher the parchmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tantalizing message before their time runs out.\n\nFull US Retail. ePub and Calibre Reader ready. Metadata is complete and up to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89d82b2f8df60915e519f29d925be5b7066148d3","amp;dn":"The+Lost+Testament+by+James+Becker+%28US+Retail+ePub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89d82b2f8df60915e519f29d925be5b7066148d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,216,43,47,141,246,9,21,229,25,242,157,146,91,229,183,6,97,72,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
