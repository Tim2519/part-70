This is 192k/bps and plays mighty fine. - Big Papi\n\nNot many available reviews for this exact CD so suffice it to say this is John Denver and it's country Christmas music. The man is a legend and died in 1997 in his own plane which was an experimental home-made kind. Anyway, good Christmas music for your collection. There's a kid's choir that joins him at one point and they are horrible at first but get better and finish up just fine. - Big Papi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:858eef8422404b029b6b1601369a12c3cc5f63a7","amp;dn":"John+Denver+-+Christmas+Celebration+Concert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"858eef8422404b029b6b1601369a12c3cc5f63a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,142,239,132,34,64,75,2,155,107,22,1,54,154,18,195,204,95,99,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
