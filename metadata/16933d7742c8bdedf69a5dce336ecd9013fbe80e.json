A keenly observed tale of a manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s awakening to life, this dark comic novel follows Lewis Lambert Strether, a middle-aged widower, on a mission to Europe to convince his fiancÃƒÂ©eÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wayward son to forsake the pleasures of Paris and return to America. Rich with fin de siÃƒÂ¨cle detail, The Ambassadors brims with finely drawn character portraits, including one of the MasterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most unforgettable heroinesÃ¢â‚¬â€the beguiling Madame de Vionnet. This was the novel that Henry James himself considered his finest, and no one is better equipped to put it into literary and historical context than Colm TÃƒÂ³ibÃƒÂ­n, whose award-winning novel The Master depicted the inner life of James in the final years of the nineteenth century.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16933d7742c8bdedf69a5dce336ecd9013fbe80e","amp;dn":"The+Ambassadors+-+Henry+James.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16933d7742c8bdedf69a5dce336ecd9013fbe80e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,147,61,119,66,200,189,237,246,154,93,206,51,110,205,144,19,251,232,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
