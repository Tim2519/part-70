He is frustrated, confused, baffled, and quite frequently, very funny. He is also a general practitioner. These are his confessions. A woman troubled by pornographic dreams about Tom Jones. An 80 year-old man who can't remember why he's come to see the doctor. A woman with a common cold demanding (but not receiving) antibiotics. A man with a sore knee. A young woman who has been trying to conceive for a while but now finds herself pregnant and isn't sure she wants to go through with it. A 7-year-old boy with &quot;tummy aches&quot; that don't really exist. These are his patients. A witty insight into the life of a family doctor, this funny and moving account will change the way you look at your doctor next time you pop in with the sniffles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99d48c50eab9249ff212495a39ac946de0f93b1a","amp;dn":"Confessions+of+a+GP+-+Benjamin+Daniels.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99d48c50eab9249ff212495a39ac946de0f93b1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,212,140,80,234,185,36,159,242,18,73,90,57,172,148,109,224,249,59,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
