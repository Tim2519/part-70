This multi-label compilation covers his best recordings for Columbia, Casablanca and MCA. Davis was a masterful song writing and his incredible run of solo hits included the US no.1 'Baby Don't Get Hooked on Me', 'One Hell Of A Woman', 'Stop And Smell The Roses', 'Rock 'n' Roll (I Gave You The Best Years Of My Life)', 'It's Hard To Be Humble', 'Let's Keep It That Way', 'Texas In My Rear View Mirror', 'Hooked On Music' and 'I Never Made Love (Till I Made Love With You)'.\n\nThey're all here - and more, including his own, definitive versions of the classics 'In The Ghetto' and 'A Little Less Conversation' (both recorded by Elvis Presley) and 'I Believe In Music'.
