Freak. Elephant. Pitiful. These are the words of Skinny, the vicious voice that lives inside fifteen-year-old Ever DaviesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s head. Skinny tells Ever all the dark thoughts her classmates have about her. Ever knows she weighs over three hundred pounds, knows sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll probably never be loved, and Skinny makes sure she never forgets it.\n\nBut there is another voice: EverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singing voice, which is beautiful but has been silenced by Skinny. Partly in the hopes of trying out for the school musicalÃ¢â‚¬â€and partly to try and save her own lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€Ever decides to undergo a risky surgery that may help her lose weight and start over.\n\nWith the support of her best friend, Ever begins the uphill battle toward change. But demons, she finds, are not so easy to shake, not even as she sheds pounds. Because Skinny is still around. And Ever will have to confront that voice before she can truly find her own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a1b4950af481643995351a154c81dc90afb5026","amp;dn":"Skinny+-+Donna+Cooner.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a1b4950af481643995351a154c81dc90afb5026","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,27,73,80,175,72,22,67,153,83,81,161,84,200,29,201,10,251,80,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
