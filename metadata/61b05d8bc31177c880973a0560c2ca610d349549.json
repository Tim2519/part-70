Together, they ruled big business. They transformed popular culture. And they provoked a national controversy. More than anything, they lived a unique and rollicking American Dream, escaping the broken homes of their youth to produce the most notoriously successful game franchises in historyÃ¢â‚¬â€Doom and QuakeÃ¢â‚¬â€ until the games they made tore them apart. This is a story of friendship and betrayal, commerce and artistryÃ¢â‚¬â€a powerful and compassionate account of what it's like to be young, driven, and wildly creative.\n\nPlease seed.
