Produced by Colin Stewart (Dan Mangan, Brasstronaut), this album finds the Singers with lush band arrangements, relatively upbeat tempos, retro organs and catchy melodies. What began at the Banff Centre Indie Band Residency with Howard Bilerman (Arcade Fire), Tony Berg (Jakob Dylan) and Shawn Everett (Weezer), Late Riser explores new pop and indie rock sensibilities, but not without a firm grounding in folk songwriting. \n\nThematically Late Riser is a continuation on the subject matter of their previous self-titled album (2010), with songs of longing, loss and heartbreak alongside historically inspired songs about the MÃƒÂ©tis rebel Louis Riel (the French-English hybrid, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Marguerite,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and beautifully somber Ã¢â‚¬Å“Red River ValleyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). Many of the stories behind the songs take on classic themes, such as the no-good, unreliable man (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jack of DiamondsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Drowning ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and the grim finality of death (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Skull &amp; CrossbonesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Red River ValleyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). Using lyric symbolism and archetypal imagery updated for modern times, the band also explores modern topics such as stage fright (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fight or FlightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and moving on after a romance (the a cappella Ã¢â‚¬Å“Liftoff CanonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). These songs are given more of an abstract treatment, but still find themselves drawing from both the sparse folk and lush arrangements that characterize this album. \n\nAlong with her talented band (including members of Dan ManganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s band, Petunia &amp; The Vipers and Snowblink), and special guests (Sam Parton of The Be Good Tanyas, Old-time fiddler/singer-songwriter Rayna Gellert, Jesse Zubot, and Josh Grange of KD LangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s band), The Abramson singers have put together an album of extraordinary beauty not soon to be forgotten...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dbe892f9c8a9423743467e0b9876d24ce1b3e1b","amp;dn":"The+Abramson+Singers+-+Late+Riser+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC.Log%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dbe892f9c8a9423743467e0b9876d24ce1b3e1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,190,137,47,156,138,148,35,116,52,103,224,185,135,109,36,206,27,62,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
