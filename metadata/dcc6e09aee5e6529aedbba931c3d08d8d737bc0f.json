Right. I forgot how most mass shooters leave a manifesto urging an end to cuts to the Head Start program.\n\nAn investigative report on the Newtown killer Adam Lanza has just been released, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s at odds with Alex JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ claim that mass shooters are liberals. The report details the items found in LanzaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home, and there wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a Howard Zinn book in sight. Sorry, Alex.\n\nAs you may have expected, Lanza turns out to be obsessed with violent and gruesome imagery. But again, Alex Jones, it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so that he could protest using animals for testing cosmetics. It turns out that Lanza was obsessed with an interactive video game called Dance Dance Revolution where you try to copy dance steps. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on a list of warning signs, but not about being a mass killer. He was obsessed with violence and dancing. What started all of this? Did he see Ã¢â‚¬Å“West Side StoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as a child and take home the wrong message from all those choreographed fights between Sharks and Jets?\n\nMeanwhile, a search of George ZimmermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home turned up... surprise... weapons and ammunition. Zimmerman had three handguns, a shotgun, and an AR-15 assault rifle... or what is known in Florida as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the basics.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ George Zimmerman had been given a public defender after telling the court he was indigent. Now he has hired a pricy private attorney. I assume that GeorgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s admirers have ponied up money once again for him. Every time he gets arrested, George Zimmerman makes money. And in his case, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a very steady stream of income!\n\nThe former Rand Paul staffer who used to dress up as a racist character he called the Southern Avenger is now calling on Republicans to avoid racist rhetoric. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to do when all of your beliefs and policies are racist. The only way to avoid racist rhetoric when your thoughts are racist is to not say what you really think. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lesson that Rand Paul has already taken to heart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcc6e09aee5e6529aedbba931c3d08d8d737bc0f","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+November+26+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcc6e09aee5e6529aedbba931c3d08d8d737bc0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,198,224,154,238,94,101,41,174,219,186,147,28,61,8,216,215,55,188,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
