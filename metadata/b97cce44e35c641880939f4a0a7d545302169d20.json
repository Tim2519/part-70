Addressing both of these key elements, this text provides a complete, up-to-date introduction to game programming. As game programming techniques are introduced, readers learn how to incorporate them into their own game engine and discover how to use the game engine to create a complete game. Every topic is explained theoretically and with working code examples. The example programs for each chapter are available online.\n\nEnables Students to Create 2D Games\nThe text covers sprites, animation, collision detection, sound, text display, game dashboards, special graphic effects, tiled games, and network programming. It systematically explains how to program DirectX applications and emphasizes proper software engineering techniques. Every topic is explained theoretically and with working code examples.
