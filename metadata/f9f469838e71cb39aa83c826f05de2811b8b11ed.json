Written by all three members of the band, &quot;Sour Times&quot; features on Portishead's debut album &quot;Dummy&quot; (1994).  The original 1994 release initially reached only number 57 in the UK, but after the success of &quot;Glory Box&quot; in 1995, it was re-released and peaked at number 13 on the UK singles chart in April. It is also the band's only song to date to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, at number 53. \n              \n              The song uses a sample from Argentine composer Lalo Schifrin's &quot;Danube Incident&quot;, and was itself sampled in the 2004 single &quot;Teardrops&quot; by The 411.\n\n\n\n              &quot;Teardrops&quot; is the third and final single from British R&amp;B group The 411. The single debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 23 then fell to number 41 the following week. It was included on the album &quot;Between the Sheets&quot;. The relative failure of &quot;Teardrops&quot; as well as the album caused the group to the dropped by record label Sony.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9f469838e71cb39aa83c826f05de2811b8b11ed","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+538","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9f469838e71cb39aa83c826f05de2811b8b11ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,244,105,131,142,113,203,57,170,131,200,38,240,93,226,129,27,139,17,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
