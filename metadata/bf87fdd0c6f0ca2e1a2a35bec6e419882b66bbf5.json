I often say my home is slovakia. But this is not only about which country I am from, it is about where I stand with my ideas, plans, life views, music, and more. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦. Things are moving so fast that I often have to stop for a moment and evaluate where I am and make sure I am where I want to be therefore I thought that the title Ã¢â‚¬Å“Where I belongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is very suitable for now and for this collection of songs that were created during this period of rapid change in my lifeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\n \t\t001 Album Art.JPG\t                        39.15 KB\n \t\t01 I'm Not Sorry.flac 44.1kHz 893kbps\t        24.94 MB\n \t\t02 Me And The Ceiling.flac 44.1kHz 732kbps\t16.92 MB\n \t\t03 Crushin' My Fairytale.flac 44.1kHz 1006kbps\t28.98 MB\n \t\t04 A Thousand Walls.flac 44.1kHz 805kbps\t20.19 MB\n \t\t05 Armor.flac 44.1kHz 928kbps\t                24.14 MB\n \t\t06 Who I've Always Been.flac 44.1kHz 951kbps\t19.75 MB\n \t\t07 Nothing Ever Can.flac 44.1kHz 850kbps\t22.22 MB\n \t\t08 Walk Beside You.flac 44.1kHz 952kbps\t        25.58 MB\n \t\t09 Gone.flac 44.1kHz 988kbps\t                23.67 MB\n \t\t10 I Was Wrong.flac 44.1kHz 822kbps\t        23.51 MB\n \t\t11 Never Be You.flac 44.1kHz 981kbps\t        20.40 MB\n \t\t12 Run Run Run.flac 44.1kHz 956kbps\t        25.42 MB\n \t\tCeleste Buckingham - Where I Belong.m3u\t          873 bytes\n \t\tWhere I Belong.cue\t                         1.35 KB\n \t\tz. audiochecker main log file.log\t         2.57 KB\n \t\tz. audiochecker.log\t                          784 bytes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf87fdd0c6f0ca2e1a2a35bec6e419882b66bbf5","amp;dn":"Celeste+Buckingham+-+Where+I+Belong+%28flac%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf87fdd0c6f0ca2e1a2a35bec6e419882b66bbf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,135,253,208,198,240,202,46,26,42,53,190,198,228,25,136,43,102,187,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
