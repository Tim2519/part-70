When people need a problem fixed fast, and discreetly, they call Dick Henry. Henry is known as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“shortcut man,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ someone who believes that the shortest answer to many problems may not always be legal. As he cuts through the red tape for his clients, who range from an elderly woman ripped off by shady contractors to a landlord with a tenant many months behind on the rent, Henry always gets the job done, no matter what the cost. In Shortcut Man, Henry spends his days hunting down slimy con men and his nights seducing Lynette, an intoxicating, long-legged vixen. But when Henry gets an assignment from porn producer Artie Benjamin, his life suddenly becomes much more complicated. Now Henry must complete the job, avoid being killed, and somehow figure out what to do with Lynette. Filled with dark comedy, whip-smart writing, and a memorable cast of characters, Shortcut Man evokes Chandler and HammettÃ¢â‚¬â€hard-boiled crime at its bestÃ¢â‚¬â€and is an exciting beginning to a crackling new series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:125ae3aeb7463bb3cb27a1ac7ac9d81387e78211","amp;dn":"Shortcut+Man+-+P.+G.+Sturges.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"125ae3aeb7463bb3cb27a1ac7ac9d81387e78211","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,90,227,174,183,70,59,179,203,39,161,172,122,201,216,19,135,231,130,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
